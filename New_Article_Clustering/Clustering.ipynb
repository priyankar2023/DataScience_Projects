nci staff with antibody drug conjugates like trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu a drug is chemically linked to an antibody that targets a specific protein on the cancer cell surface credit wikimedia commons bioconjugator cc by sa more and more people with lung cancer are receiving treatments that zero in on specific genetic changes in their tumors targeted therapies now patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc have another targeted therapy option on august the food and drug administration fda gave accelerated approval to trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu for adults with nsclc that has a certain kind of mutation in the her gene called an activating mutation around of people with nsclc have this kind of her mutation to be eligible for treatment with enhertu patients must also have cancer that can t be removed by surgery unresectable or has spread to other parts of the body metastatic and they must have already received one or more cancer therapies this approval is highly anticipated and exciting said joel neal m d ph d a lung cancer doctor and researcher at the stanford cancer institute up until this point there were no fda approved targeted therapies for her mutant lung cancer dr neal added the approval was mainly based on the results of a phase clinical trial called destiny lung in which treatment with enhertu shrank tumors of more than half of the study participants all patients in the study had nsclc that had gotten worse after receiving other treatments after two decades of failed attempts in clinical trials we have learned more about the biology of her in lung cancer said bob t li m d ph d m p h of memorial sloan kettering cancer center those lessons eventually led to the development and approval of enhertu said dr li who is the lead researcher of destiny lung and several other trials of enhertu under fda s accelerated approval the companies that make enhertu astrazeneca and daiichi sankyo have to conduct another clinical trial to confirm the treatment s benefits such as improving how long patients live without their cancer getting worse testing for her mutations alongside enhertu fda approved two companion diagnostic tests that check for her gene mutations guardant cdx which uses a blood sample and oncomine dx target test which uses a sample of tumor tissue this kind of genetic testing often called biomarker testing is the critical first step for treating people with lung cancer dr neal said people who have never smoked are female and are of asian descent are more likely to have a her mutation in their lung tumors he noted but all patients with advanced nsclc should get biomarker testing for this her mutation and other mutations that have matching targeted therapies dr li said such as those in the egfr alk and braf genes panel testing such as next generation sequencing is now standard of care for people with advanced lung cancer he added fda immunotherapy approval marks a first for lung cancer atezolizumab is approved to treat some people with non small cell lung cancer after surgery the her mutations seen in lung cancer make the her protein activated all the time dr neal explained that s slightly different from breast cancer in which tumors can have high levels of the her protein from gene overexpression he said results of the destiny lung study the destiny lung trial was conducted in multiple countries and included patients half of the participants had never smoked were female and were asian all participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of enhertu given as an infusion every weeks tumors shrank in of people who received the lower dose including one person whose tumors disappeared completely among those whose tumors shrank the treatment kept their cancer at bay for a median of months dr li and his team considered the lower dose to be optimal because it shrank tumors as well as the higher dose and caused fewer side effects enhertu is fda approved at the lower dose it s also important to know how many participant s tumors stayed the same size called stable disease while taking enhertu dr neal said as long as it isn t causing too many side effects doctors often keep patients on a lung cancer treatment even if their tumors are staying the same size or only shrinking slightly he explained the percentage of people who had stable disease in destiny lung is not yet available but in an earlier clinical trial of enhertu for people with metastatic her mutant nsclc of the participants had stable disease side effects of enhertu enhertu is a type of drug known as an antibody drug conjugate the antibody portion binds to the her protein on the surface of lung cancer cells then a chemotherapy drug that is tethered to the antibody slips inside the cancer cells and kills them the drug part of it the chemotherapy is very potent so the side effect profile of this drug is mostly similar to chemotherapy dr neal explained such as nausea hair loss and low blood cell counts the side effects are mostly similar to standard chemotherapy but may be less harsh because enhertu is delivered directly to cancer cells dr li noted enhertu also comes with a warning for a potentially deadly side effect called interstitial lung disease pneumonitis in studies of enhertu in people with nsclc and breast cancer around of patients experienced interstitial lung disease pneumonitis that s higher than what s seen with other targeted therapies for lung cancer dr neal noted most of the time interstitial lung disease pneumonitis is mild and reversible but occasionally this could be severe and life threatening dr li said when the research team got better at detecting early symptoms of this condition and treating it typically with steroids this side effect became less severe he added there are many ongoing studies of potential her mutant lung cancer treatments that are very exciting dr li said some are looking at other antibody drug conjugates that bind to her or new small molecule drugs that block the activity of her if proven safe and effective these drugs could potentially be used sequentially or combined with enhertu he said capmatinib approved for met mutant lung cancer on august fda gave full approval to capmatinib tabrecta for treatment of metastatic nsclc that has a mutation in the met gene called exon skipping around to of people with nsclc have tumors with this type of gene mutation in fda granted an accelerated approval to capmatinib for adults with this kind of cancer the full approval is based on new study results confirming the treatment s benefits according to the new findings capmatinib shrank the tumors of of patients who had not received any previous cancer treatment and prevented tumors from growing back for a median of months among those who had already received one or more cancer treatments capmatinib shrank the tumors of and kept them in check for about months the most common side effects of capmatinib which is taken as a pill twice a day are swelling edema nausea and pain capmatinib can also cause serious and potentially deadly side effects namely interstitial lung disease pneumonitis liver toxicity and pancreatic toxicity it can also seriously harm unborn babies another drug called tepotinib tepmetko is also fda approved for people with nsclc that carries a met exon skipping mutation dr neal noted

subscribe september by nci staff a fluorescence microscope image of neuroblastoma cells updated results from a large study continue to show that dinutuximab is an effective treatment for children with high risk neuroblastoma credit istock in a clinical trial of nearly children with high risk neuroblastoma researchers have confirmed that the immunotherapy drug dinutuximab unituxin can help children live longer five years after being treated with dinutuximab given along with two immune boosting compounds and isotretinoin of children in the study were still alive and had no evidence that their cancer had come back or their tumors had grown the study results were published july in the journal of clinical oncology the findings come from an extension of a clinical trial that initially compared isotretinoin alone with isotretinoin in combination with dinutuximab and the two immune boosting compounds the initial trial showed that the dinutuximab combination substantially increased the number of patients who had no evidence of their disease coming back at years and improved how long patients lived overall survival in the food and drug administration approved dinutuximab to treat children with high risk neuroblastoma once the survival benefit of dinutuximab became evident although children continued to be enrolled in the study all new participants were treated with dinutuximab the survival outcomes of these participants confirm the efficacy of dinutuximab shown in the initial study said alice yu m d ph d of the university of california san diego who led the study which was carried out by the nci sponsored children s oncology group nita seibel m d head of pediatric solid tumor therapeutics in nci s cancer therapy and evaluation program said the longer term data in such a large number of patients provide important confirmation of dinutuximab s effectiveness however dr seibel said she s particularly excited about ongoing and planned studies that are building on this initial success with dinutuximab by maximizing the drug s potential i m hopeful that we can make further improvements in the treatment of children with high risk neuroblastoma she said ami v desai m d a pediatric oncologist at the university of chicago and part of the research team agreed dinutuximab has transformed the way we treat patients with neuroblastoma dr desai said how can we further enhance the efficacy of dinutuximab and how can it be used in different parts of therapy getting a better understanding of dinutuximab s impact neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of immature nerve cells it s rare with only children diagnosed each year in the united states mainly infants and those under years old the disease is called high risk when it has certain features that indicate it is aggressive such as if it has spread from its original location approximately half the children diagnosed each year have high risk disease children with high risk neuroblastoma typically undergo an intensive course of treatment that involves three phases in the initial phase known as induction children are treated with chemotherapy and sometimes surgery to remove the primary tumor the second phase called consolidation involves high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant followed by radiation in the third phase known as post consolidation isotretinoin has been typically given in cycles to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the disease from coming back in the original trial which ended in more than kids with high risk neuroblastoma were randomly assigned to receive either isotretinoin or isotretinoin combined with dinutuximab and the immune system boosting drugs il and gm csf after years of children who received the dinutuximab combination and isotretinoin were still alive compared with of those treated with isotretinoin alone similarly of children treated with the dinutuximab combination remained free of tumor growth or recurrence compared with who were treated with isotretinoin alone although new participants continued to be enrolled the study s randomization component was stopped in because of these encouraging results and the researchers applied for fda approval of dinutuximab continuing to enroll patients in the dinutuximab arm allowed the study team to further evaluate the treatment s impact on survival and to better understand the side effects of dinutuximab in a much larger group of patients keeping the study open and giving all patients dinutuximab as part of post consolidation therapy also gave patients access to the drug while it was still under consideration for approval dr yu said dr seibel pointed out that nci played a huge role in manufacturing dinutuximab and making it available for the trial dr yu agreed after the drug was approved nci transitioned the manufacturing operation to united therapeutics which went on to commercialize the drug building on the initial success the nonrandomized part of the study the largest trial to date of children with high risk neuroblastoma included children most patients completed all six cycles of therapy five of the cycles included dinutuximab which is given intravenously after years the majority were still alive and free of tumor growth or recurrence also known as event free survival as were a subset of patients aged months and older whose cancer was very advanced stage time after treatment event free survival overall survival years years stage ages months stage ages months twelve percent of the children in the study had undergone a tandem transplant a newer procedure in which a patient receives two stem cell transplants instead of one although tandem transplant is associated with better outcomes than a single transplant and has become standard therapy in this study having undergone a tandem transplant did not appear to improve how long patients lived without their tumor growing or recurring the dinutuximab combination was associated with multiple severe side effects with pain being among the most common some severe side effects including allergic reactions capillary leak syndrome fever and low blood pressure were more frequent during treatment cycles that included il dr desai pointed out that since the nonrandomized study was conducted il which is highly toxic is no longer being used as part of post consolidation therapy with dinutuximab this shift came after a study conducted in europe suggested that the addition of il added toxicity without improving outcomes and preliminary data from a subsequent trial showed similar results despite having less rigid eligibility requirements for enrollment than the randomized study the nonrandomized study showed similar survival rates and side effects confirming the success of the initial study dr desai said next steps for dinutuximab dr yu said that despite the effectiveness of dinutuximab the cancer still came back within years in of patients in the study what can we do to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from the dinutuximab combination given the severe side effects associated with the treatment she asked treatments continue to evolve for neuroblastoma for high risk disease two stem cell transplants prove effective one area of intense research to address that question is to identify biomarkers in the current study the researchers found several biomarkers that show potential for identifying patients who might benefit most from the treatment work is ongoing to better understand the role of these and other biomarkers dr yu said other studies are looking into whether dinutuximab can be given as part of induction therapy in combination with chemotherapy a small pilot study has already been completed and a phase trial is being planned to test dinutuximab as part of induction therapy if that study shows a survival benefit to using dinutuximab up front the next steps might be to look at whether we can do away with stem cell transplantation because that procedure is really hard on patients dr seibel said older post for common form of bladder cancer chemo combo effective alternative to bcg newer post enhertu marks first

august by nci staff with non muscle invasive bladder cancer the tumor resides strictly in the bladder s interior lining called the mucosa credit national cancer institute long before the covid pandemic fueled supply chain crisis there was a shortage of a cancer therapy called bcg that s used to treat the most common form of bladder cancer bcg has long been the go to initial treatment for a form of the disease called high risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer nmibc the continuing bcg shortage has forced doctors to rely on other treatments for their patients with high risk nmibc among the alternatives they have turned to is a combination of two chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and docetaxel and researchers from the university of iowa have now published results from the largest study to date of people with high risk nmibc treated with this combination overall they reported of people who received periodic treatment with both drugs after surgery to remove their bladder tumor were still alive years later without the cancer returning the findings were published july in the journal of urology none of the more than patients in the study died from bladder cancer during the study period and side effects from the drugs which are delivered directly into the bladder were largely minor the results with the chemotherapy combination were similar to or even somewhat better than what is typically seen in patients treated with bcg said the study s lead investigator vignesh packiam m d of the university of iowa health care department of urology we re very excited to have this treatment option for patients who would otherwise be left without an effective alternative there was broad agreement among urologic oncologists that the findings show the chemo combination is an excellent option when bcg is not available the study s findings will be extremely helpful for the urologist to discuss with patients when bcg is not available as all patients want to know how their outcomes could be affected by the bcg shortage wrote joshua meeks m d ph d a urologic oncologist at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine and colleagues in an accompanying editorial sandeep gurram m d of the urologic oncology branch in nci s center for cancer research called the findings very promising in particular dr gurram noted that the combination appeared to work well even in people with the most concerning types of high risk nmibc he cautioned however that this study had important limitations and is not the final word on the treatment of high risk nmibc regardless of bcg s availability for example it wasn t a clinical trial that directly compared bcg with gemcitabine and docetaxel several ongoing and soon to be launched clinical trials should help address some of the most important outstanding questions he noted from bcg to chemo combos non muscle invasive bladder cancer is so called because the tumor resides strictly in the bladder s interior lining called the mucosa among other tasks this mucosal lining operates as a barrier between the smooth muscle that encases the bladder and the urine within it about of bladder cancer diagnoses are nmibc and about of these are at high risk of progressing to muscle invasive bladder cancer a tumor is called high risk when its size or other features suggest that it s biologically aggressive one form of high risk nmibc for example is called carcinoma in situ in which the tumor spreads along the mucosa in a pancake like shape these tumors are not only aggressive dr packiam explained but particularly resistant to treatment with bcg and when they do come back it s often in a more invasive form the treatment course for high risk nmibc begins with removing the bladder tumors via a surgical procedure called turbt surgery is followed by additional treatments known as adjuvant therapy to kill off any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of the cancer coming back for most people with nmibc if no additional treatment is given after surgery the disease often recurs at some point so the primary goal of adjuvant therapy is to prevent recurrences for as long as possible and also to prevent recurrences from invading into the bladder dr packiam said tumors that invade to the muscle wall of the bladder require more aggressive surgery including potentially removing the bladder entirely for decades adjuvant therapy with bcg a severely weakened form of a bacterium that was originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine was the gold standard for preventing progression and recurrence in high risk nmibc he explained but starting in the early s supplies of bcg started to run short after one of the two companies that produced it stopped doing so only merck now manufactures bcg for use in the united states and according to the company manufacturing issues as well as increased global demand continue to limit its availability last year the company announced that it was building a new manufacturing facility for bcg allowing the company to triple its output of the therapy however bcg supply isn t expected to recover for at least several more years single chemotherapy drugs have been among the most common alternatives used during the bcg shortage dr packiam said but they have been shown to have decreased effectiveness against high risk nmibc combinations of chemotherapy drugs have proven to be effective in people with high risk nmibc whose cancer comes back after bcg treatment dr gurram said so it made sense he continued to study chemotherapy combinations as an initial or first line treatment promising recurrence free survival michael o donnell m d another member of the university of iowa research team pioneered the use of the gemcitabine docetaxel combination to treat high risk nmibc not long after the bcg shortage began so for this study the team looked back in time at data from patients who received adjuvant treatment with the chemo combination at their hospital the data review covered patients treated from may about year after the bcg shortage started through april patients in the study initially received both drugs each one delivered separately via a catheter directly into the bladder once a week for weeks induction therapy if there were no serious problems with side effects or the cancer did not come back patients then got both drugs once a month for up to years maintenance therapy the analysis included people and the median follow up was months time after starting treatment patients alive without their cancer returning months months months in addition to more than of patients remaining alive without their cancer returning at years only one patient in the study had to go on to surgery to have their bladder removed the most common side effect was having to urinate frequently and often feeling the urge to urinate dr packiam acknowledged that the study has several limitations among them was that the study looked back in time all of the patients were treated at the same hospital and nearly all patients in the study were white all of these things may limit how applicable the findings are to the broader us population absolutely larger studies in more diverse populations are needed he said however he continued the bcg shortage created a situation where doctors and their patients had no choice but to use something else iowa has been seriously affected by the bcg shortage we have very little supply here dr packiam said so we really have come to rely on this combination more definitive answers on the horizon one of the most important takeaways from the study dr gurram said is that the gemcitabine docetaxel combination appeared to work well in all high risk patients including those with carcinoma in situ is using less bcg okay researchers are investigating another potential solution to the bcg shortage using a lower dose of bcg per treatment several studies have suggested that using a lower dose may be a suitable option including a study published last year showing that in people with high risk nmibc using one third of the standard dose of bcg didn t appear to be any less effective than the standard full dose the study had a large population of people with high risk tumors that are often resistant to bcg and they are still getting very good recurrence free survival numbers he said nevertheless evaluating how the combination performs in people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds will be important we ve seen time and again that something can perform well in retrospective studies but once it gets to the community we can see differing results dr gurram said the need to travel to the hospital monthly to get the maintenance treatment is a challenge of this particular regimen dr packiam noted that s particularly true in rural areas and for people without easy access to transportation it does produce some logistical burdens for patients he said along those lines dr meeks and his colleagues wondered about the extent to which maintenance therapy is even needed as with bcg treatment over time many patients stop taking it so it will be important to determine if or months of gemcitabine and docetaxel is necessary they wrote in the meantime dr gurram said researchers are looking more carefully at existing and potential new treatments for high risk nmibc for example a large nci supported trial that will randomly assign patients to either bcg or the docetaxel gemcitabine combination is in the works but hasn t yet launched and a series of clinical trials are underway testing bcg in combination with immunotherapy drugs for patients with high risk nmibc dr gurram said he s hopeful that newer therapies can further improve treatment of nmibc across the board but

subscribe august by nci staff under the milan criteria to get a liver transplant a person with liver cancer can have only a single liver tumor no bigger than cm in diameter or two to three tumors of cm or less at the time of diagnosis credit cancer research uk cc by sa for some people with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc the most common type of liver cancer a liver transplant is the only hope for a cure but the availability of donated organs for transplant is severely limited so when a donor liver becomes available doctors and public health experts must decide who is most likely to benefit a new study provides the strongest evidence to date in support of us guidelines for determining which people with liver cancer are eligible for a liver transplant the study s investigators said the us guidelines go beyond the strictest and most well established criteria for a transplant which largely focus on the extent of cancer that s present in the liver the size and number of tumors at the time a person is diagnosed if treatments can shrink a patient s tumors so that they fit within these criteria commonly known as the milan criteria the guidelines say that person may also be a suitable candidate for a transplant in the study of people with hcc whose tumors shrank enough after treatment to meet the milan criteria for a liver transplant were still alive years after receiving a donated liver by comparison people with hcc whose disease met the milan criteria at the time of their diagnosis fared somewhat better about were still alive years after liver transplant the team reported july in jama surgery treating liver cancer to reduce the size and number of tumors before surgery is known as downstaging the new findings provide solid data to examine the practice of giving liver transplants to people with hcc that has been downstaged to meet the milan criteria wrote transplant surgeon yuman fong m d of city of hope medical center in an editorial that accompanied the study that s important several liver cancer experts said because until now evidence to support these guidelines has been limited and they have not been adopted worldwide a year survival rate of more than is considered a great cure rate for liver cancer said laura kulik m d of northwestern memorial hospital in chicago who was not involved in the new study we ve always been nervous about the risk of the tumor coming back after transplant in these downstaged patients said dr kulik a liver disease specialist who helps evaluate and manage patients before and after a transplant this study shows that we re not wasting donated organs or taking them away from other people who are more likely to benefit the study which included more than patients is very solid because it has such a long follow up time and looked at such a large number of people said tim greten m d head of the gastrointestinal malignancy section in nci s center for cancer research who also was not involved in the study considering the selection criteria for a liver transplant the incidence of hcc the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide has been rising in the united states and elsewhere increasing the demand for transplants most transplanted livers are from organ donors who have recently died other candidates for a liver transplant include people with serious liver diseases other than cancer such as hepatitis b and c unfortunately people who qualify for a liver transplant are competing for a limited supply of donor organs dr greten said for more than two decades decisions about which hcc patients are eligible for a liver transplant have been based on a small study in italy that study showed that people with small but inoperable liver tumors did about as well after a liver transplant as people with liver diseases other than cancer said parissa tabrizian m d a surgeon at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai and the lead investigator on the new study the study conducted at a single hospital in milan opened the door to liver transplants for people with hcc that is confined to the liver and had a profound impact on the survival of liver cancer patients dr tabrizian said it allowed the transplant community to establish a simple set of criteria for selecting those most likely to benefit from a transplant according to the milan criteria transplant recipients must have only a single hcc tumor no bigger than centimeters about inches in diameter or two to three tumors of centimeters or less at the time of diagnosis having smaller and fewer tumors indicates that the cancer is less likely to have invaded blood vessels in the liver and therefore is less likely to have spread beyond the liver and come back or recur after a transplant dr kulik explained recurrence is the number one cause of death after a transplant she said however dr tabrizian said the milan criteria have been repeatedly criticized for being too restrictive so some experts wondered if people whose tumors could be downstaged to within the milan criteria might fare as well after a transplant as those who met the milan criteria from the start dr greten said based on earlier smaller studies with shorter follow up times some guidelines including those from the american association for the study of liver diseases now suggest that patients whose cancer can be downstaged to meet the milan criteria be considered for a liver transplant however they note that the evidence from these earlier studies is not strong year survival in transplant recipients to seek more evidence on how patients who were downstaged fare after a transplant over the long term dr tabrizian and her colleagues analyzed data from adults with hcc who had liver transplants at five us transplant centers from to of those patients were within the milan criteria at diagnosis and stayed within them until the time of transplant milan criteria group and had hcc that was successfully downstaged to within the milan criteria downstaged group at the time of transplant the remaining patients had hcc that could not be downstaged or had progressed beyond the milan criteria but ultimately underwent a transplant beyond milan criteria group patient group number year overall survival after transplant year survival rate after transplant hcc recurrence years after transplant within milan criteria downstaged beyond milan criteria more people in the milan criteria group were still alive and years after a transplant than those in the downstaged group see the table people in the beyond milan criteria group had statistically similar survival rates after transplant to those in the downstaged group however the chances that their cancer would come back after transplant was markedly higher although people in the downstaged group had lower survival and higher recurrence rates than those in the milan criteria group after transplant they were nevertheless able to achieve meaningful long term outcomes after successful downstaging the study team wrote these are patients who would not have been considered for a curative treatment and would not have lived as long with treatment options other than a transplant dr tabrizian said on the other hand she said those whose tumors cannot be downstaged should probably not be considered for a transplant we ve been learning more and more that it s not just size and number of tumors that matters when predicting how well patients will do dr tabrizian continued study identifies drug target to prevent some liver cancers mice that lack the spectrin protein in their livers are protected from liver cancer for example she explained the ability to shrink tumors to meet the milan criteria is thought to indicate that the cancer is less aggressive than those tumors that don t respond well to treatment dr tabrizian s team also identified several patient factors such as having more than three liver tumors at diagnosis that were linked with the likelihood that a person s cancer would not respond well to treatments aimed at downstaging these factors may aid in decision making and risk benefit assessment the study team wrote the team also found that transplant patients who received a liver from a living donor which is an option for some people fared similarly to those who received a liver from a deceased donor in a living donor transplant one section of a healthy living person s liver is removed and used to replace the patient s diseased liver this approach is possible because the liver can quickly regrow in both the donor and recipient however the surgery still has some risk for the donor organ donations offer people with liver cancer a new chance at life the new study results provide data that can better inform decisions about allocating organs to people with hcc and other liver diseases dr fong wrote in his editorial for people with hcc tumors that are initially beyond the milan criteria he wrote developing a panel of additional tumor markers like alpha fetoprotein and others that might predict which patients will do best with a transplant could help to optimize organ use more robust studies are still needed to make this downstaging policy globally acceptable dr tabrizian said hopefully we can continue to show excellent results for these patients and make this a standard of care worldwide and as we improve our understanding of tumor biology and of this disease we hope we can continue to expand the criteria for transplant eligibility and increase cure rates she continued although the shortage of healthy donor organs remains a challenge she hopes that by increasing awareness and increasing organ donations this problem could be solved finally dr kulik said the study highlights the importance that people with liver cancer be seen by experts in liver cancer treatment and transplantation to increase their chances of receiving a potentially lifesaving transplant this has become easier with the rise of telemedicine and video consultations she added and she continued we see such a difference in people after they undergo a transplant and have a new chance at life older post abnormal collagen may be weak spot for pancreatic

collagen is made of fibrous protein that provides structural support to many tissues in the body credit tom deerinck and mark ellisman nicmr a protein called collagen which provides structure to tissues is found almost everywhere in the human body from the skin to the bones pancreatic cancer cells can also produce their own misshapen collagen a new study has found and this abnormal collagen appears to have additional cancer promoting functions in experiments in mice shutting down the production or effects of the abnormal collagen made treatments for pancreatic cancer more effective in the nci supported study the research team found that the abnormal collagen ramped up activity in pancreatic cancer cells that increased tumor growth and survival but when the research team stopped cancer cells in mice from producing the abnormal collagen everything changed perhaps most importantly cancer fighting immune cells started to move into the tumors and when the researchers then treated the mice with a commonly used immunotherapy drug their tumors shrank dramatically the immunotherapy drugs were minimally effective in mice that had the abnormal collagen the study findings were published august in cancer cell by raghu kalluri m d ph d of the university of texas md anderson cancer center and his colleagues when the collagen is present around the cancer cells it s functioning like a cloaking device so that the immune cells aren t able to recognize those cancer cells or get to those cancer cells so they are almost invisible to the immune system but then when this collagen is removed the immune cells are able to see and kill them dr kalluri said this abnormal collagen makes a potentially promising therapeutic target he explained because it s only produced by cancer cells this is what everyone wants to find an abnormal protein that s specific to cancer cells said grace ault ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who was not part of the study any potential strategies to target this abnormal collagen are years away from clinical testing dr ault warned but these early results suggest that such an approach may hold promise different collagens different functions pancreatic cancer is notoriously resistant to commonly used treatments among other roadblocks pancreatic tumors become packed with stromal supportive cells and the molecules they produce including collagen sometimes the cancer cells are actually a minority of the cells in a pancreatic tumor explained dr ault normal tissues rely on collagen to perform many of their functions a protein with a branched fiber like structure made up of chains called and it gives tissues both strength and flexibility it s the most abundant protein in the human body it s present in our bones ligaments and cartilage it s everywhere said dr kalluri collagen is normally produced by cells called fibroblasts past work from dr kalluri and his team using mice found that the presence of normal collagen may actually help suppress pancreatic cancer growth but other research had suggested that pancreatic cancer cells can produce their own collagen whether this collagen is different and whether it helps tumors survive and grow wasn t well understood when dr kalluri and his colleagues reviewed a database that captures the molecular makeup of human cancer cell lines used for research they noticed that the collagen produced by pancreatic cancer cells had a different structure rather than two chains and one chain called a heterotrimer it only contained chains producing an abnormal structure called a homotrimer this abnormal collagen didn t appear to be the result of any gene changes mutations in the cancer cells instead its production was driven by a difference in how the genes responsible for collagen production were expressed through a process called methylation this action known as an epigenetic change turned off the gene that normally produces the chain when they looked at mice engineered to develop pancreatic tumors they found that the abnormal collagen appeared to be promoting rather than suppressing tumor growth when the researchers engineered mice to develop pancreatic cancer that couldn t produce the abnormal collagen tumors grew more slowly and the mice lived longer their tumors also had more of the tumor suppressing collagen normally produced by fibroblasts cancer cells isolated from the mice lacking the abnormal collagen and grown in the lab were slower to divide and more sensitive to the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine gemzar a standard treatment for pancreatic cancer than cancer cells that could still produce the abnormal collagen the cells lacking the abnormal collagen were also slower to form tumors when implanted into other mice uncloaking a tumor how does the abnormal collagen promote tumor growth further work in pancreatic cancer cells isolated from mice found that the homotrimers were somehow boosting a communication pathway that can drive runaway cell growth in contrast normal collagen suppressed this pathway tumor microbiome linked to survival in pancreatic cancer study in mice tests altering microbiome as part of treatment the researchers then zeroed in on a receptor on the surface of pancreatic cancer cells called integrin which seemed to be turning on this signaling pathway when the abnormal collagen bound to it when the researchers shut down this receptor in pancreatic cancer cells the cells stopped growing and dividing even those that still produced the abnormal collagen when the research team looked for integrin in tumor samples taken from people with pancreatic cancer they found that almost all expressed high amounts of the receptor tumor samples with the highest levels of the receptor had fewer immune cells called t cells than tumors that had proportionally lower levels of the receptor and people with tumors containing the highest levels of the receptor died sooner looping back to mice several good things appeared to happen in pancreatic tumors engineered to lack the abnormal collagen among other things it changed the microbiome of the tumor the microorganisms and viruses that live in the tumor tissue the fact that tumors deep in the body can have resident microbes is a relatively recent discovery in cancer biology explained dr ault it used to be thought that bacteria were mostly found in places in the body that were open like the mouth or the colon said dr ault and people thought that inside in contained tissues like the pancreas you didn t have all these bacteria but it turns out they re all over in tumors in mice that were engineered to lack the abnormal collagen the populations of bacteria that lived in the tumors shifted compared with those found in nonengineered mice these microbial changes were associated with the presence of more immune cells such as t cells in the tumor but the bacteria weren t the only things linked to these immune cell changes in the tumors shutting down the aberrant collagen they showed also blocked signaling by the cancer cells that directly impeded immune cells allowing t cells to flood into the now friendlier tumor microenvironment as a result mice with tumors that couldn t produce the abnormal collagen lived longer when treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor a type of immunotherapy than mice with tumors that could produce the homotrimer harnessing a potential vulnerability making this homotrimer may be a very early event in a cancer cell s journey said dr kalluri but more work needs to be done to connect the dots as to how this happens he added mutations in a cancer causing gene called kras which are present in almost all pancreatic tumors may be causing the initial shutdown of normal collagen chain production he explained but further study is needed to tease out if this is the case regardless of the initial events that lead to a buildup of this abnormal collagen dr kalluri and his team are now looking at whether it could be a target for new cancer treatments in people one strategy they re exploring is developing drugs that can shut down integrin which could potentially block abnormal growth signaling even in the presence of the collagen homotrimer combining such a strategy with other treatments has potential explained dr ault while blocking the activity of the abnormal collagen might not kill cancer cells it could make them more sensitive to chemotherapy or immunotherapy she explained the researchers would also like to engineer car t cells that can bind to the abnormal collagen since this collagen is only found in and around cancer cells that could direct such t cells to go to the cancer cells not anywhere else dr kalluri explained we d also like to understand if this collagen is unique to pancreatic cancer or if it s found in other cancers as well he added early results from his lab suggest that the homotrimer might also be found in lung colon and head and neck cancer cells he explained expanding the potential pool of cancer types that might be targeted with such an approach but to understand how widespread this collagen is we still need to do more work he said older

staff inflammation is considered a hallmark of cancer there is evidence that inflammation may both promote and constrain tumors credit istock in a german pathologist observed white blood cells in cancerous tissues white blood cells are part of the body s inflammatory response which is activated to fight invaders such as pathogens and heal damaged tissue based on his observation the pathologist rudolf virchow proposed a new idea about the origins of cancer some tumors he suggested may start at sites of chronic inflammation that is places where inflammation persists after it is no longer needed his basic idea has stood the test of time chronic inflammation in certain parts of the body such as the cervix or the colon can increase the risk of cancer in those organs but virchow s observation marks just the beginning of a story about cancer and inflammation that is still being written today inflammation is considered a hallmark of cancer researchers are exploring the potential role of inflammation in many aspects of cancer including the spread of the disease within the body and the resistance of tumors to treatment in the coming years researchers hope to learn more about whether patients with cancer might benefit from treatments that target inflammation around tumors some early studies have yielded promising results the numerous and diverse links between cancer and inflammation all present opportunities to develop therapies said michael karin ph d of the university of california san diego who studies mechanisms of inflammation although much of the research on potential therapies is in the early stages dr karin predicted that strategies to inhibit cancer related inflammation will one day become a mainstay of modern cancer therapy the complex relationship between cancer and inflammation an inflammatory process begins when damaged tissues release certain chemicals including histamines and prostaglandins in response white blood cells travel to the damaged tissues and produce substances that cause cells to divide and grow to rebuild tissue the inflammatory process ends when the injury has been healed when inflammation occurs at the wrong times or becomes chronic however problems can arise many researchers describe inflammation as a double edged sword on the one hand the immune system is constantly vigilant monitoring the body for foreign invaders such as pathogens said stephen hewitt m d ph d of the experimental pathology laboratory in nci s center for cancer research but on the other hand inflammation that is not effectively controlled can potentially contribute to the development and growth of cancers in some cases tumor cells may take advantage of the inflammatory environment to actually exclude tumor fighting immune cells the immune system is also on alert for threats from inside the body that is tumors scientists have observed that there may be tumor cells in our bodies that we never know about because the immune system is going out and killing those tumor cells said dr hewitt what s more cancer treatments such as immunotherapy may kill cancer cells by activating some of the inflammatory processes used to fight pathogens so researchers have been studying the interplay between inflammation and immunotherapy noted dr karin in short there is evidence that inflammation may both promote and constrain tumors over the past decade researchers have used this knowledge to explore new treatments for cancer including anti inflammatory drugs a small clinical trial recently demonstrated the potential value of this approach researchers enrolled patients with breast cancer that had spread to tissue near the breast but not to other parts of the body locally advanced or that had spread to other parts of the body metastatic the patients received chemotherapy plus an anti inflammatory drug called l nmma which blocks the production of nitric oxide a molecule involved in inflammation researchers are planning a phase trial to test the anti inflammatory drug l nmma to treat metaplastic breast cancer a rare and often lethal form of the disease credit courtesy of dr garth kruger the treatment regimen shrank the tumors in approximately half of the patients in the study based on historical data the researchers estimated that about a third of the patients would have responded to chemotherapy alone three patients with locally advanced breast cancer had all signs of their cancers go away following treatment we saw some remarkable responses in patients whom we did not expect to respond said lead investigator jenny chang m d director of the houston methodist hospital s neal cancer center her study was the first to test l nmma in patients with cancer to learn more about how the anti inflammatory drug worked in the body the researchers studied the cells molecules and other structures surrounding tumors the tumor microenvironment their findings suggested that by disrupting the production of nitric oxide the drug helped reduce inflammation around the tumors this seems to have made it possible for tumor targeting immune cells to penetrate the tumors and kill the cancer cells according to the researchers in some chemotherapy resistant breast cancers inflammation is like a fortress around the tumor dr chang said the microenvironment exudes pro inflammatory proteins that make it impossible for immune cells to penetrate but l nmma appeared to break down those barriers even among patients who were not responding to other treatment options she added dr chang and her colleagues are planning an nci supported phase clinical trial to test the drug in more patients the study will include people with metaplastic breast cancer a rare and often lethal form of the disease inflammation is a critical component of metaplastic breast cancer said dr chang timing is everything in a normal inflammatory response immune cells produce chemicals that can kill a pathogen these chemicals known as reactive oxygen species can also damage the dna of normal cells which increases the risk of mutations that could lead to cancer timing is everything said jennifer kay ph d of the silent spring institute who studies how healthy cells become cancerous if the optimal timing of biological processes related to inflammation is altered the chances of cancer occurring increase for instance in the normal inflammatory response the production of cells to replace injured tissue is normally delayed until reactive chemicals are no longer being produced this sequence of events reduces the chances that replacement cells will sustain dna damage including cancer causing genetic mutations caused by reactive chemicals but during chronic inflammation the production of reactive chemicals can overlap with the production of cells that restore injured tissue dr kay noted this can potentially increase the risk of cancer the reasons inflammation starts when it is not needed or becomes chronic are not always clear some recent studies have focused on the failure of mechanisms that normally shut down inflammation at the appropriate times biology is complicated because there s a lot that goes into keeping a body healthy dr kay said evolution has produced a vast network of tightly coordinated biological processes many of these biological processes are interdependent so disruptions to one pathway can have ripple effects elsewhere potentially leading to uncontrolled inflammation dr kay added learning how to manipulate the inflammatory system at the university of texas md anderson cancer center researchers are investigating the molecular mechanisms of inflammation including a protein involved in inflammation called stat we are interested in learning how to manipulate components of the inflammatory system to improve the body s ability to fight tumors said stephanie watowich ph d who directs the center for inflammation and cancer at md anderson abnormal levels of stat activity have been linked to certain cancers and drugs that inhibit the protein are being tested in people with cancer a growing body of evidence including results from mouse studies suggests that stat inhibitors may have distinct and complementary effects the drugs may prevent a tumor from growing while also enhancing the immune system s ability to clear the remaining tumor cells according to dr watowich that s the hope with drugs that inhibit stat dr watowich said future research will explore whether blocking other proteins in immune cells could also improve the ability of those cells to clear tumor cells she added new mouse models with functional immune systems l nmma was originally developed to treat heart failure dr chang and her colleagues decided to test the drug a nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor in patients with cancer based in part on research in mice by nci investigators a team led by david wink ph d in nci s center for cancer research studied drugs that inhibit nitric oxide including l nmma in new mouse models that had functional immune systems most mouse models used in cancer research have lacked normal immune systems the new models represent an important technology advance for studying cancer and inflammation as the work on l nmma suggests according to dr hewitt having mice with functional immune systems allows us to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the interplay between the tumor and the immune system said dr hewitt once the pilot study of l nmma had been completed dr chang s team and the nci researchers visualized the tumor microenvironments in the patients and the mice in both species prior to treatment with the drug tumor targeting immune cells appeared to be stuck outside the tumors unable to infiltrate the cancers the images were really remarkable said dr wink the way the immune cells oriented themselves relative to the tumor targets was strikingly similar between the species the investigators conducted additional studies to confirm their suspicions that inflammation had been preventing immune cells from killing cancer cells tumor biopsies from patients who responded to l nmma showed increased levels of tumor targeting immune cells and reduced levels of pro inflammatory proteins as did tumor biopsies from mice treated with the drug the researchers found these results confirmed their view that l nmma helps to reduce inflammation and allow immune cells to infiltrate tumors according to dr chang what we observed in the patients who responded was exactly what the mouse models had predicted would happen she said putting knowledge to work for patients dr wink expects to see more studies testing combinations of drugs that target inflammation and other agents for treating cancer this is the new frontier he said more than years after rudolf virchow s observation dr wink continued the time is right for a collaborative science project focused on inflammation he envisions a comprehensive effort modeled on the human genome project to describe the molecular components involved in inflammation we now have the ability to map the nitty gritty of inflammation dr wink said to find the achilles heel of inflammation we need to study all of the elements and the biological processes together dr karin agreed and issued a call to action after several decades of fundamental research on inflammation and cancer it s time to put our knowledge to work for patients he said older post pembrolizumab improves survival in advanced triple negative breast cancer newer post abnormal collagen may be weak spot

august by nci staff adding the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab keytruda to chemotherapy can help some patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer live longer than if they received chemotherapy alone new results from a clinical trial show in the trial keynote overall survival improved only among patients whose tumors had relatively high levels of the pd l protein a pd l combined positive score of at least among patients with this combined positive score median overall survival was months for those who received pembrolizumab and chemotherapy versus months for those who received chemotherapy alone these results are based on a median follow up of months javier cort s m d ph d of the international breast cancer center barcelona spain and his colleagues reported their findings july in the new england journal of medicine in an earlier analysis of interim data from the trial dr cort s and his colleagues had reported that among patients with a pd l combined positive score of at least the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy improved progression free survival compared with chemotherapy alone based on those results in the food and drug administration fda approved the combination therapy for patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer whose tumors have a pd l combined score of at least the approval covers patients with cancer that cannot be removed surgically unresectable that has spread to tissue near the breast but not to other parts of the body locally advanced or that has spread to other parts of the body metastatic the new keynote results confirm that pembrolizumab is a breakthrough treatment for triple negative breast cancer wrote xavier pivot m d ph d of the institute of cancerology strasbourg strasbourg france in an accompanying editorial new treatments needed for advanced triple negative breast cancer triple negative breast cancer tends to be more aggressive harder to treat and more likely to recur than other forms of the disease such as hormone receptor positive or her positive breast cancers conventional chemotherapy drugs have not been effective against triple negative breast cancer and new treatment options are needed said jung min lee m d of the women s malignancies branch in nci s center for cancer research in the keynote trial patients with advanced unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy plus placebo or chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab fda fully approves sacituzumab for breast cancer approval is for locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer the study assessed the amount of time before the disease worsened progression free survival and overall survival in all patients in those with pd l combined positive scores of or more and in those with combined positive scores of or more the trial was funded by merck the manufacturer of pembrolizumab the pd l combined positive score is essentially a measure of the extent to which cells in a tumor produce pd l the immune checkpoint protein that pembrolizumab targets by blocking immune checkpoints pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors unleash the immune system against cancer cells among patients with a combined pd l score of more than pembrolizumab did not improve median overall survival which was months in the pembrolizumab chemotherapy group and months in the chemotherapy alone group among patients with a combined pd l score of or more at months after starting treatment about of patients in the combination treatment group were still alive compared with about of those in the chemotherapy alone group the incidence of treatment related side effects including serious side effects was similar between the two groups of patients in the study the most common side effects in both groups were a drop in red blood cells a lower than normal number of white blood cells and nausea these side effects are typically associated with chemotherapy and adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy did not increase the incidence of side effects among patients the study authors wrote research progress and future questions after the approval of the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy for advanced triple negative breast cancer fda approved the combination therapy for people with early stage disease in that approval was based on results from a different trial keynote in that study patients with high risk early stage triple negative breast cancer benefited from pembrolizumab given with chemotherapy before surgery and then continued as a single agent as an additional or adjuvant treatment after surgery this is an exciting time for research on triple negative breast cancer said dr lee we have now seen a benefit from an immune checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy in a subgroup of patients in both the advanced and early stages of the disease dr lee cautioned however that more than half of all patients with triple negative breast cancer have pd l combined positive scores of less than so more work is needed to find effective treatments for these patients in his editorial dr pivot noted that people diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer are not a homogeneous group future studies he added will try to identify which individuals are more or less likely to benefit from pembrolizumab

august by nci staff enlarge in mice with fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma blocking kdm b leads to epigenetic changes that close dna preventing the pax foxo fusion protein from turning on cancer related genes credit adapted from epigenetics and gene expression by biorender com retrieved from https app biorender com biorender templates scientists have found a unique vulnerability in some rhabdomyosarcoma tumors that could potentially be targeted with an experimental drug rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in muscle tissue although it can be diagnosed at any age it primarily affects children in some people with rhabdomyosarcoma two proteins become fused together creating an abnormal protein called pax foxo that drives cancer cell growth rhabdomyosarcoma tumors with this fusion protein grow and spread quicker than tumors without it but due to the fusion protein s relatively flat shape it s been hard for scientists to find drugs that block it in an nci funded study jun yang m d ph d of st jude children s research hospital and his colleagues tried a different approach targeting an accomplice of the fusion protein they found that the fusion protein relies on an enzyme called kdm b to drive rhabdomyosarcoma growth and survival so they turned to a recently developed drug that blocks the activity of kdm b when combined with chemotherapy the kdm b blocking drug nearly eliminated rhabdomyosarcoma tumors in mice according to findings published july in science translational medicine what s powerful about this rigorous study is that it validates kdm as a dependency for fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma said marielle yohe m d ph d of nci s center for cancer research who was not involved in the study but before this treatment is tested in children with rhabdomyosarcoma i would want to see a little bit more information dr yohe said epigenetic enzymes in childhood cancer every year children in the united states are diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma around one third of those children have fusion positive tumors dr yohe noted although the standard treatments surgery chemotherapy and radiation cure most children with fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma they don t offer much hope to those with fusion positive tumors dr yang said fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma is very aggressive and often spreads through the body even for children with fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma who do survive he added the treatments can have harsh long term side effects such as hearing loss heart problems and secondary cancers so there is a big challenge remaining even for survivors he said dr yang s lab studies epigenetics chemical changes that shift how dna is folded and packed into the cell s nucleus thereby controlling how genes are activated more specifically the team studies how epigenetic changes interact with genetic changes to accelerate cancer development and growth earlier studies led by nci researchers showed that blocking epigenetic enzymes changed the core circuitry of rhabdomyosarcoma dr yohe said that approach has since been applied to a lot of other pediatric cancers neuroblastoma ewing sarcoma and infant leukemia she added some studies have found that the fusion proteins in these cancers rely on a family of enzymes known as kdm kdm enzymes remove chemical marks from histones proteins that dna winds around these epigenetic marks affect how tightly dna is wound and folded with that in mind dr yang and his colleagues explored the role of kdm enzymes in fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma needs kdm b first the researchers looked at the levels of various kdm enzymes in rhabdomyosarcoma tumors they found higher levels of kdm b in tumors than in healthy muscle tissue of patients with fusion positive tumors and of mice engineered to develop fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma in mice rhabdomyosarcoma tumors genetically engineered to lack kdm b activity grew slower than rhabdomyosarcoma tumors with normal kdm b activity and in cells grown in lab dishes a drug that blocks the activity of kdm enzymes including kdm b killed fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma cells but not healthy muscle cells kdm enzymes are a subgroup of the kdm family in mice implanted with human rhabdomyosarcoma tumors the kdm blocking drug slowed tumor growth and prolonged the lives of the mice compared with a placebo plus the mice didn t lose any weight suggesting that the drug didn t cause serious side effects in combination with standard chemotherapy the scientists also tested the kdm blocking drug alongside a chemotherapy pair vincristine plus irinotecan camptosar that is a common treatment for children with rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after initial therapy separately both treatments the chemotherapy pair and the kdm blocking drug slowed tumor growth but together the three drug combination completely eliminated tumors in nearly all of the mice i would have loved to have seen more studies establishing the mechanism of why the kdm blocking drug works so well with the chemo dr yohe said it s important to know why it is that the drugs work well together so that you can best take advantage of that she added an ongoing trial for children with rhabdomyosarcoma is exploring a similar approach dr yohe noted the trial is testing chemotherapy in combination with mocetinostat a drug that blocks enzymes that remove different epigenetic marks from histone proteins opening and closing dna so how do kdm b and the pax foxo fusion protein work together to drive rhabdomyosarcoma growth and survival pax foxo is a transcription factor which means that it turns specific genes on while kdm b makes epigenetic changes that unfold tightly packed dna by unfolding dna kdm b helps the fusion protein reach and turn on multiple cancer related genes in rhabdomyosarcoma cells the researchers found but the kdm blocking drug stops kdm b from unfolding dna thereby preventing the fusion protein from turning on these cancer related genes without these cancer related genes rhabdomyosarcoma cells can t survive the scientists explained kdm blocking drugs the kdm blocking drug used in the study called qc is the best such drug available so far dr yang said most kdm inhibitors are not potent at all this one is very potent and selective meaning it blocks only the intended enzymes and not other proteins he said a decade ago there were no drugs targeting kdm enzymes dr yohe said so just having an effective inhibitor that s available as a pill is a big deal a similar drug called qc is currently being tested in a clinical trial of people with advanced colon cancer dr yang added but before advancing qc to a clinical trial for children with rhabdomyosarcoma it would be helpful to have more information dr yohe said such as how long the tumor shrinkage lasts and whether the drug works in other models of rhabdomyosarcoma dr yang and his colleagues are already trying to learn more about this potential treatment approach in several ongoing lab studies including whether qc plus chemotherapy can block the metastatic spread of fusion positive

subscribe august by nci staff for people with advanced cancer regular home visits from community health workers reduced hospital trips and increased use of palliative care among other benefits a new study found credit istock for people with advanced cancer severe side effects from treatment often force them to the hospital or the emergency room although these time consuming and quite often expensive hospital trips potentially could be prevented by better communication about symptoms between patients and their doctors the reality is that such discussions don t typically happen as frequently as they should now a new study shows that community health workers chws may help bridge this communication gap in cancer care in the study having a chw directly consult with people newly diagnosed with advanced cancer or cancer recurrence including assessing their symptoms and helping them with advance care planning substantially decreased hospitalizations and emergency room visits advance care planning is a formal decision making process to guide a person s future medical care often in the event that the person is not capable of making those decisions themselves the community health care worker is almost like your extra pair of eyes and ears said david j park m d of the virginia k crosson cancer institute at providence st jude medical center who co led the study having that extra person to pick up on symptoms helped us treat patients before their symptoms forced them to go to the hospital in the study people with advanced cancer including those near the end of their life who had routine visits from a chw in addition to usual care over a month period were much less likely to be hospitalized during that period than patients who received usual care alone and the benefits of bringing chws into the care process didn t end there patients who worked with a chw also made greater use of advance care planning palliative and hospice care and had improved mental and emotional health compared with those who received usual care the interactions provided by the chws consisted of regular telephone calls and in person visits the findings were published june in jama oncology this is important work said diane st germain r n m s of the community oncology and prevention trials research group in nci s division of cancer prevention what i think this boils down to is that patients have access to someone providing a high degree of personal attention to address their care needs no one wants to be in the emergency department or the hospital especially people who have limited time to live said manali i patel m d m p h of the stanford university school of medicine who co led the study this study provides more evidence that health care clinics and systems can integrate chws to improve the way that they deliver health care for people with cancer this helps patients spend less time in the emergency department or hospital and have better experiences building on earlier studies of chws and people with cancer anyone can be a chw once they are trained to serve as a public health worker they take on many roles including providing educational resources to patients offering emotional support and helping screen patients for symptoms but although chws are frequently used in the health care system it s been hard to quantify their impact on the patient experience a previous study of medicare enrollees led by dr patel showed that having chws provide symptom screening resulted in fewer hospitalizations in another study she led when chws provided information and guidance about advance care planning to military veterans with advanced cancer those patients also had fewer hospitalizations in this new study drs park and patel wanted to test the effect of combining both symptom screening and advance care planning on hospitalizations in a chw led intervention an enduring effect their study included adults who were newly diagnosed with advanced cancer or recurrent solid and blood cancers and being treated at the st jude crosson cancer institute a community cancer clinic in fullerton california participants were randomly assigned to receive either usual care provided by their clinical team or usual care plus a month consultation program led by a chw the chws conducted weekly symptom screening via phone and in person visits as well as discussions about advance care planning within months of enrolling in the study only patients in the chw group went to the hospital including visits to the emergency room compared with patients in the usual care group after year of follow up patients in the chw group still were nearly less likely to visit the hospital or emergency room than people in the usual care group dr park explained that after working with a chw patients may become more proactive about alerting their doctor to their symptoms there s a little bit of teaching that happens during these meetings with the health care worker where the patient is used to reporting things and they may start having these conversations with their physician he said what s more patients in the intervention group were times more likely to use advance care planning times more likely to use palliative care and nearly two times more likely to use hospice care compared with patients in the usual care group they also reported better mental and emotional health than patients in the usual care group there was no difference in the number of deaths between the two groups during the study period however none of the patients who interacted with a chw were hospitalized in the month before their death compared with patients in the usual care group marilyn dewland a retired nurse who served as one of the chws in this study said that one of the most powerful effects of her role was just being present and listening to the patient a significant part of it was nonverbal ms dewland said you re developing a trust relationship so that the patient is willing to share and be forthright sometimes just keeping their emotional state stable can help because when people get frightened and worried they run to the er questions remain in an accompanying editorial in jama oncology ana i tergas m d m p h of city of hope comprehensive cancer center said that although the study results are promising it remains to be seen whether the findings are generalizable beyond the crosson cancer institute ms st germain agreed how does this intervention play out in different settings including rural as well as urban how does this play out in more diverse patient populations she said there s also potential variability in the frequency of the interactions some people may need only a monthly check in with a chw some people may need one every weeks it s not one size fits all dr park said dr patel noted that a follow up study is now underway to look at the impact of a chw led intervention at multiple community cancer clinics which might answer some of these questions ms st germain pointed out that it will be important for chws to undergo rigorous training and have access to the clinical team when issues do come up dr tergas said it will also be important to compare the cost of the intervention with potential savings from hospitalizations and emergency room visits that were avoided technologies like smartphone apps and other remote monitoring devices are also being studied as ways to improve symptom monitoring and control but factors like cost and ease of use may limit their use dr park said however it s not either or he said there s a role for both technologies and chws in delivering cancer care the inclusion of technology may in fact improve intervention effectiveness dr tergas said in her editorial regardless of the approach it s clear that incorporating more of a human touch into the cancer care process can make a difference for people with advanced cancer dr park said that s the one thing that is easy to take for granted or forget about because it s hard to quantify older post new cancer model shows promise in predicting if treatment will shrink tumors newer post targeting the accomplice a potential

july by nci staff immunofluorescence image of micro organospheres created from a human lung tumor showing tumor cells yellow and green and t cells red credit image used courtesy of xiling shen will a specific cancer treatment actually work for a person diagnosed with cancer every person s cancer is different and even when a tumor has a genetic change for which there s a matching targeted therapy there s no guarantee a given treatment is going to work but based on the results of a small study funded in part by nci a team of researchers hopes to soon offer oncologists a new tool to guide treatment choices for their patients the tool is a new type of personalized tumor model called micro organospheres and in a small study of eight people with advanced colorectal cancer the researchers used the model to accurately predict whether the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin would shrink their tumors results from the study led by xiling shen ph d the ceo of the biotechnology company xilis were reported june in cell stem cell to create the micro organospheres the research team takes tissue from a patient s tumor biopsy and runs it through a desktop device about the size of a standard printer the end product thousands of three dimensional mini replicas of the cancer suspended in tiny compartments on a lab dish creating the models required much less tumor tissue than is usually required to grow other cancer models that use a patient s own tumor tissue dr shen and his colleagues reported and they were created quickly in less than weeks that is much faster than similar models can be created explained one of the study s leaders david hsu m d ph d of the duke cancer institute their analyses also showed that the micro organospheres largely retained the molecular features of the tumors from which they were created and the models had many other components of the tumor s surroundings including immune cells and structural cells the makeup of this tumor microenvironment as it s called can influence how tumors respond to treatment the micro organospheres overcome a lot of the barriers that have prevented similar tumor models from being used to help direct everyday patient care dr hsu said a larger study is being launched to determine whether these early findings hold up dr shen and dr hsu along with a third member of the team hans clevers m d ph d of the pharmaceutical company roche and a pioneer in organoid technology jointly founded xilis in to commercialize the technology the findings from this first study are just a proof of concept dr hsu acknowledged we need a larger study to have the data needed to say if these models precisely capture patients response to treatment from pdx and organoids to micro organospheres cancer models including tumor cell lines and animal models are widely used research tools they usually serve as generalized stand ins for a specific type or form of cancer but over the past decade researchers have taken these representations of cancer to the next level developing personalized models created from individual patients tumor tissue efforts to create these patient derived tumor models as they re called are considered to be an important part of a concept known as precision oncology treating a patient s cancer based on its unique clinical and molecular features the two most common patient derived models are mouse models called patient derived xenografts pdxs and tumor like cell clusters called organoids that are grown in lab dishes because they grow as human tumors in living tissue there was initially great hope that pdxs might be used to direct care for individual patients explained konstantin salnikow ph d of nci s division of cancer biology and who oversees nci s patient derived models of cancer program study affirms reliability of cancer pdx mouse models the mice retain the genetics of human tumors from which they were created but it soon became clear that because of certain limitations in their current forms pdx models may primarily be most useful as research tools and not to help direct the care of individual patients dr salnikow said those limitations include the time it takes to establish them a minimum of several months and sometimes up to a year dr salnikow said and because pdx mice lack functioning immune systems he added they can t capture the important interactions between immune cells and tumors which can influence how cancer treatments work organoids which are created using specific types of stem cells in tumor tissue are grown in laboratory dishes these models can be created somewhat more quickly and inexpensively than pdx models but when it comes to cancer treatment typically needs to begin quickly after diagnosis usually within a few weeks said dr hsu who specializes in treating colorectal cancer not only does creating organoids require a relatively large amount of tumor tissue which isn t always easy to come by it also can take several months in addition the number of organoids produced is relatively small for the time being these factors may limit their potential for use in everyday patient care he explained micro organospheres are intended to address both models limitations an electrical engineer by training dr shen developed the system for creating micro organospheres at duke he recently left the university to lead xilis full time the system s lynchpin is a technology called microfluidics which allows for precise handling of very small amounts of material suspended in specialized liquids producing the micro organospheres also involves growing the collected cells in oil based droplets which required the researchers to develop a way to then remove the oil without harming the cells the entire process is highly automated and takes place in a small desktop device by automating production the system eliminates much of the variability involved in growing organoids which requires multiple manual steps and streamlines the entire process dr shen explained as a result he continued there won t be different results depending on who cultured the cells and rather than a just few organoids or pdxs the product that emerges from the system is thousands of miniaturized tumors dr shen said and those mini tumors are ready for drug testing within days model predicts response to oxaliplatin treatment to test the system s performance the researchers first showed that they could establish micro organospheres from human tumors grown in a pdx model and do it quickly they then moved on to creating the models directly from human tumor tissue specifically from a core needle biopsy taken from a person recently diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer not only were they able to create a large number of micro organospheres from this sample they reported but they did it in days when they tested a large set of commonly used cancer drugs against the micro organospheres they found that those that were treated with oxaliplatin were readily killed oxaliplatin they reported also shrank tumors in the patient from which the models were created the result from the testing on the micro organospheres played no role in determining whether the patient would receive the treatment they then expanded the study to include seven more people recently diagnosed with colorectal cancer creating micro organospheres for each patient in less than weeks from the time of their biopsies three of the additional seven patients had their tumors shrink in response to oxaliplatin treatment and micro organospheres from their tumors also were killed by the drug and for three of the four patients whose tumors did not shrink in response to oxaliplatin micro organospheres from their tumors likewise were unaffected or only mildly affected by this chemotherapy drug to get a better idea of the extent to which micro organospheres actually represent patients tumors the research team analyzed tumor samples from people with lung ovarian and kidney cancers and compared them with the respective micro organospheres created from those tumors important genetic features and specific genetic changes such as mutations of specific cancer related genes were largely the same in the micro organospheres and tumor samples from which they were created the research team reported the micro organospheres also contained many of the same noncancer cells found in the tumor tissue samples and in similar amounts these included immune cells and cells called fibroblasts both important components of tumor microenvironment dr salnikow stressed that s dramatically different than what you get with pdx models where human and mouse cells are mixed together he said additional testing of immune based treatments also showed that immune cells in the micro organospheres behaved as expected in response to the therapies these analyses provided information about the micro organospheres that is important for us to see in terms of developing a precision oncology platform dr salnikow said larger studies and refinements the next step in advancing the technology is to see how it performs in larger groups of patients and in people with different cancer types dr hsu said a study will soon start recruiting about people with colorectal cancer that has spread to their liver dr hsu said the researchers are also planning small studies in people with breast cancer nci expands repository of cancer research models expansion addresses need for models that closely resemble human tumors dr salnikow called the model a breakthrough because it overcomes many of the shortcomings of other patient derived models he cautioned however that improvements are likely needed for micro organospheres to have a significant impact on guiding patient treatment among the most important upgrades he believes is incorporating a way to mimic how cancer drugs are processed or metabolized by the body which can affect their impact on tumors for simpler drugs like oxaliplatin he explained the current system may be adequate but dr salnikow noted that many cancer drugs are more challenging for the body to metabolize and those drugs need to be tested with a system that incorporates drug metabolism he said other researchers are developing similar patient derived tumor models he continued some may be more suitable than others for predicting whether a given patient will respond to treatment depending on the specific therapy or type of cancer the person has all models are an approximation the goal is to get as close as possible to how the cancer is behaving in humans dr salnikow continued even the best models will never be perfect there are so many factors that affect response to treatment he said many that we don t even know about yet older

by nci staff in a study of mice nci researchers tested a new kind of immunotherapy made from small pieces of cytomegalovirus a common virus credit created with biorender com although the immune system can pack a powerful punch against cancer many tumors find ways to turn off or block immune cells but nci researchers may have found a clever way to give immune cells the upper hand by disguising the cancer as a viral infection in a study involving mice injecting small pieces of a virus directly into tumors activated immune cells shrank tumors and kept them from growing back the injected bits of viral proteins called peptides coat the outsides of cancer cells explained the study s senior scientist john schiller ph d of nci s center for cancer research so you are fooling the immune system into thinking i have this big virus infection i better go attack it dr schiller said the viral peptides catch immune cells attention and unleash an attack but don t actually cause an infection added the study s lead scientist nicolas uburu ph d also of nci s center for cancer research to make sure the immune cells mount a robust and relentless attack the researchers used peptides from cytomegalovirus cmv a virus that most people s immune systems have seen before around out of people in the united states and out of worldwide are infected with cmv and it usually doesn t cause any symptoms when the researchers injected cmv peptides into tumors in mice that were previously infected with cmv the treatment shrank tumors sometimes completely and helped the mice live far longer than those treated with a placebo the findings were published june in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences it s a very innovative approach said klaus fr h ph d of oregon health and science university dr fr h who wasn t involved in the nci study is developing cmv based preventive vaccines for cancer and other diseases i think this study is a very clever way of using cmv so i am curious to see what happens in clinical trials he said leveraging the immune response to cmv once you ve been infected with cmv it sticks with you for life as a chronic or latent infection as long as you have a healthy immune system you probably won t experience any symptoms but even if you don t know you ve been infected with cmv your immune system does cmv infection generates massive amounts of immune cells called t cells that hunt down cmv not only that but multiple kinds of cmv fighting t cells are generated dr uburu noted and it s one of the few immune responses that gets better as you get older normally immunity goes downhill as we age dr schiller added in addition although some cancers and cancer treatments can weaken the immune system studies have shown that cmv fighting t cells are active in people with cancer studies have even found anti cmv t cells inside tumors of people with cancer so we thought why don t we harness that dr schiller said cmv peptide treatment cures mice with lung cancer in dr schiller s group discovered that the outer shell of human papillomavirus hpv binds the outsides of cancer cells but not healthy cells in follow up experiments they found that small cmv peptides did an even better job of killing cancer cells than delivering the corresponding cmv genes by an hpv based gene delivery vehicle for the new study they created a mixture of peptides from various parts of the mouse version of cmv to test the peptides the researchers first infected mice with mouse cmv prompting the mice to make anti cmv t cells six months later when the infection became latent the mice were implanted with lung cancer cells that quickly developed into tumors can mrna vaccines help treat cancer trials have been underway for nearly a decade and shown promising early results the nci team then injected the tumors several times with either a physiological salt solution or a mixture of cmv peptides plus a chemical that boosts the immune response compared with the salt solution treatment with the cmv peptides greatly slowed tumor growth in many of the mice treated with cmv peptides tumors disappeared completely in addition cmv peptide treated mice lived for several months on average while those treated with the salt solution lived for only a few weeks on average the mice with no remaining tumors and long lasting survival were considered cured of their cancer the cmv peptide treatment also changed the types and numbers of immune cells inside tumors in cmv treated tumors cmv fighting t cells became activated and cancer fighting t cells appeared other kinds of cancer fighting immune cells flooded the tumors too and there were higher levels of protein signals called cytokines that tell immune cells to attack long term protection from cancer growth a major draw of immunotherapy is the potential to generate long term protection against cancer and that s exactly what the nci team saw with the cmv peptide treatment when they implanted cured mice with more lung cancer cells months after the initial treatment new tumors never formed the researchers saw similar results with other kinds of cancer injecting the cmv peptides into skin and colon derived tumors in mice slowed tumor growth flooded tumors with t cells and helped the mice live longer the cmv peptide treatment appears to be doing several beneficial things drs schiller and uburu explained first cmv fighting t cells kill cancer cells coated with cmv peptides because they look infected then like sharks sensing blood in the water cancer fighting t cells sniff out cancer cell guts that have spilled out prompting them to attack cancer cells and third other cancer fighting immune cells enter the tumor and release signals that egg on the attack all of that combined creates long lasting protection against cancer that s why it s so powerful to harness these anti cmv t cells because they can do the job of many different immunotherapies at once dr uburu emphasized potential advantages of cmv immunotherapy there are several potential advantages of this approach over currently used cancer immunotherapies the scientists explained for one synthetic virus peptides can be made easily and in large quantities they pointed out and the treatment wouldn t have to be tailored to each individual patient or even to a particular type of cancer in contrast some immunotherapies such as car t cell therapy and vaccine therapy are typically custom made for each patient making them time consuming and expensive to produce this cmv peptide treatment is a simple off the shelf product that you could even use in low resource settings because it doesn t require sophisticated molecular profiling of tumors dr schiller said but a caveat is that this will only work in cmv positive people so you have to check first if someone has cmv already or not dr fr h noted another caution dr fr h said is that mice injected with high doses of cmv peptides became very sick it s not clear why he said but it s possible that anti cmv t cells attacked healthy tissues that were accidentally coated with the high dose of viral peptides in mice that toxicity could be controlled by lowering the dose of the peptides without changing how well the treatment worked dr uburu noted with all this in mind the nci researchers are setting their sights on a clinical trial of the cmv peptide treatment we are trying to push this forward and bring more proof of concept in human tumor samples that could lead to a clinical evaluation dr uburu said older post dabrafenib trametinib combination approved for solid

tafinlar and trametinib mekinist for the treatment of people with nearly any type of advanced solid tumor that has a specific mutation in a gene called braf this mutation known as braf v e can increase the growth and spread of cancer cells the accelerated approval announced on june covers adults and children years of age or older with braf v e positive tumors that cannot be removed by surgery or have spread to another part of the body metastasized fda previously approved the dabrafenib trametinib combination for the treatment of people with advanced forms of specific cancers whose tumors have the braf v e mutation including non small cell lung cancer melanoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer many patients with these and other cancers have their tumors tested for certain cancer related genetic changes to help guide their treatment choices for example braf v e mutations are found in nearly half of people with melanoma many types of metastatic cancers are tested for braf mutations and the fda approval is one more reason to have this testing said lyndsay harris m d who leads nci s cancer diagnosis program she is also a lead investigator with nci match one of the clinical trials that led to the new approval results from three clinical trials including two with adult patients and one with pediatric patients provided the data for the approval some trial participants had rare cancers such as biliary tract cancer ovarian cancer and glioma a type of brain cancer the trials did not include patients with colorectal cancer which is known to be resistant to the combination therapy the new approval expands the number of treatments approved for solid tumors anywhere in the body these tumor agnostic therapies may be used to treat any cancer that has the specific molecular alterations or biomarkers targeted by the medicines data from nci match roar trials informed approval dabrafenib and trametinib block different growth promoting signals in tumor cells that are activated by the v e braf mutation dabrafenib inhibits signals from the braf protein whereas trametinib inhibits signals from the mek protein tumors that initially respond to dabrafenib alone may develop resistance to the therapy by activating signals from the mek protein combing dabrafenib and trametinib may prevent tumors from using this escape mechanism the drug combination was evaluated in the nci match trial this study has enrolled approximately patients based on the molecular features of their tumors rather than where in the body the tumors arose the fda approval was based in part on results from adult patients with the braf v e mutation enrolled in a substudy of nci match participants had different tumor types including ovarian cancers gastrointestinal cancers and cancers of the central nervous system an important finding of our study was that several rare types of cancer responded to the drug combination including ovarian cancers which are difficult to treat said dr harris some of the patients had very long responses lasting for years dabrafenib trametinib combo better than chemo for glioma the targeted therapy combo was better and safer for treating tumors that had a braf v mutation findings from the roar trial were also part of fda s analysis sponsored by glaxosmithkline and novartis roar enrolled adults with specific braf v e mutation positive solid tumors including glioma and biliary tract cancer in a study published in researchers conducting the roar trial wrote that routine testing for the braf v e mutation should be considered for all patients with biliary tract cancer the roar and nci match studies included a total of adult patients with types of braf v e mutation positive tumors of this group had a partial or complete response to the combination therapy among patients with the most common tumors in the trials the overall response rate was for those with biliary tract cancer for those with high grade gliomas and for those with low grade gliomas the most common side effects of the combination therapy in adults included fever fatigue nausea and rash the treatment was well tolerated dr harris said the side effects were identical to those reported in previous trials of the dabrafenib trametinib combination among the patients in the pediatric trial that contributed data to the fda s analysis the overall tumor response rate was for most of these patients their responses lasted at least months and had responses that lasted at least months sponsored by novartis the pediatric trial included patients with low grade gliomas and langerhans cell histiocytosis that had come back after initial treatment or resisted therapy the side effects were similar to those observed in the roar and nci match trials cancer basket trials a potential boon for rare cancers nci match and roar are both known as basket trials such clinical trials enroll patients with different types of tumors and assign them to groups or baskets based on criteria such as the molecular features of their tumors for many rare cancers it can be challenging to develop clinical trials that recruit enough patients to show a benefit from certain therapies particularly for treatments that target tumors with uncommon genetic alterations basket trials offer a potential solution to this problem by allowing researchers to efficiently study treatments in multiple rare cancers according to april salama m d who directs the melanoma program at the duke cancer institute and co led the nci match substudy testing the dabrafenib trametinib combination nearly of the patients in the nci match substudy experienced a clinically meaningful benefit from the combination therapy dr salama said most of the patients had previously received multiple therapies and had few additional treatment options as we learn more about the molecular underpinnings of cancer basket trials will continue to become more common dr salama predicted these studies are complicated to conduct but they may also be one of the best ways to bring new treatment options to the clinic older post androgen receptor may explain sex differences in melanoma treatment

july by nci staff enlarge melanoma cells in which immunofluorescence analysis highlights areas where the androgen receptor is present red in boxes credit journal of experimental medicine doi https doi org jem cc by when it comes to melanoma a potentially deadly type of skin cancer there isn t equality between the biological sexes when melanoma has spread from its original location metastasized male patients don t live as long as female patients melanoma in males is also more likely to become resistant to several commonly used treatments for the disease a new study that analyzed melanoma samples from people treated with targeted therapies that inhibit the proteins braf and mek may help explain why the androgen receptor levels of this protein in tumor cells jumped during treatment with braf and mek inhibitors particularly in males but also to a lesser extent in females the androgen receptor binds to hormones called androgens such as testosterone which are found at much higher levels in males than females it directly contributes to the development and growth of prostate cancer and is a major target of treatment for that disease in the study published june in nature the research team concluded that signaling through the androgen receptor also likely plays a role in treatment resistance in melanoma additional studies in mouse models of metastatic melanoma found similar sex based survival differences between males and females as those seen in people using the mouse models the researchers also found that blocking the androgen receptor improved how long male and female mice treated with these targeted therapies lived the study has numerous implications explained one of the study s researchers timothy heffernan ph d of the university of texas m d anderson cancer center these range from potential cautions about the use of testosterone supplements in people undergoing treatment for melanoma to possible new strategies for improving treatment response there s a lot of potential but a lot more research is needed to better understand the impact of hormone signaling on the response to both targeted therapies and immunotherapy in melanoma dr heffernan said survival signaling substantial improvements in understanding the role braf and mek proteins play in melanoma have helped revolutionized its treatment these proteins form part of a cell communication pathway that influences critical functions such as cell division and cell death drug combinations that target both of these proteins simultaneously have greatly extended the survival of people with advanced melanoma but treatment resistance almost always develops over time researchers had noticed that this resistance tends to develop more rapidly in males to look more closely at this phenomenon the research team studied the treatment responses of patients with metastatic melanoma who had been treated with braf mek inhibitors for up to weeks before surgery while tumors in of the female patients shrank by more than during treatment only of male patients experienced a similar reduction in tumor size at years after treatment of females hadn t experienced a relapse of their cancer compared with only of males the team repeated these comparisons in several additional groups of people with metastatic melanoma that couldn t be removed surgically and who underwent treatment with braf mek inhibitors in most of these groups including a total of more than patients females had greater reductions in tumor size and lived longer both without their disease progressing and overall than males samples taken from patients tumors before and during treatment found higher levels of androgen receptors in male patients tumors during treatment compared with before treatment a much smaller increase in androgen receptor expression was seen in samples taken from female patients likely because they have naturally lower levels of testosterone the study team explained in follow up analyses in the group of patients who underwent surgery after treatment with braf mek inhibitors androgen receptor levels in tumors before treatment were similar between people whose tumors shrank substantially and those whose tumors did not but the researchers did find evidence that people with higher levels of androgen receptor expression in their tumors during treatment had a lower likelihood of having a tumor response the androgen receptor can be expressed in males and females in a variety of tissues though not normally in the cells that give rise to melanoma explained kathleen kelly ph d of nci s center for cancer research who was not involved with the study but this can change with the stress of treatment under such stressful conditions when cancer progresses gene expression gets a lot more plastic dr kelly said the cells are capable of expressing in a random way a lot of genes that they normally wouldn t express they re looking for a way to escape treatment and i think what s going on is that those that manage to express the androgen receptor have found an alternative pathway for growth she explained leveling the playing field to look more closely at the potential role of the androgen receptor in treatment resistance the team used several mouse models to pick apart the differing treatment responses between the sexes regardless of the model used when the team implanted mice with human melanoma tumors and treated the animals with braf mek inhibitors they saw results similar to those seen in people tumors in male mice grew faster despite treatment cancer treatment side effects are more common in women women experience harmful effects more often regardless of the type of cancer treatment study finds when the team used the gene editing tool crispr to delete the gene for the androgen receptor in melanoma cells before implanting them into mice everything changed both male and female mice benefitted equally from treatment with the braf mek inhibitors even when given testosterone to boost androgen receptor signaling this suggested to us that it s the androgen receptor and androgen dependent signaling that s conferring resistance in males said dr heffernan also similar to the results seen in people the uptick in androgen receptor expression by the melanoma cells came during not before treatment which indicates an adaptive response by the cells dr heffernan explained additional experiments in male and female mice including one involving enzalutamide xtandi which blocks androgen signaling seemed to confirm the receptor s role in resistance to treatment with braf and mek inhibitors understanding the how these results raise the intriguing possibility of adding a drug that blocks the androgen receptor to treatment with braf mek inhibitors the study team wrote as researchers have learned more about the potential role of the androgen receptor in different cancer types clinical trials have already started testing the addition of androgen blockade to standard treatments for kidney ovarian and breast cancer among others use of braf mek inhibitors is also being studied in cancers other than melanoma including thyroid and lung cancer said dr heffernan and a braf mek targeted treatment combination was recently approved by the food and drug administration to treat any type of cancer with a specific mutation in the braf gene this suggests that our studies have to expand beyond melanoma to study the impact of androgen receptor signaling across braf mutated tumors said dr heffernan for now it s a mystery exactly how the androgen receptor can make tumors resistant to braf mek inhibitors added dr kelly but understanding the how may eventually suggest strategies to block androgen receptor signaling in a more targeted way depending on cancer type said dr heffernan such work would also likely have implications beyond targeted therapy he added for example another recent study found that androgen receptor signaling also may limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy the goal of our research is to define and exploit the mechanisms that are conferring resistance to targeted and immunotherapies he said because those additional studies will allow researchers to better understand how to best treat patients older post immunotherapy s skin side effects are microbes to blame newer post dabrafenib trametinib combination approved for

skin cells yellow play host to a broad array of bacteria pink fungi blue and other microbes credit alex valm university at albany ny nih drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors are a type of immunotherapy that have transformed the treatment of many cancers but for many patients these drugs can cause a wide range of side effects including itching and painful skin rashes sometimes the skin side effects are bad enough that people stop taking the drugs a new study in mice suggests that the skin side effects may occur because the drugs cause the immune system to attack new microbes that take up residence on the skin if confirmed in humans this insight could ultimately lead to better ways to treat or prevent the skin complications of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment the findings suggest that these skin side effects may be triggered by new additions to the communities of bacteria fungi and other microbes that live in and on us collectively known as the microbiota said yasmine belkaid ph d of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid one of the study s senior investigators people are exposed to new types of microbes all the time especially in hospitals dr belkaid said immune checkpoint inhibitors take the brakes off cancer killing immune cells but these activated immune cells can also harm healthy cells and tissues leading to inflammation and immune related side effects the mechanisms underlying these side effects which are often treated with steroid drugs are not clear the study results open up a new way of thinking about skin side effects and possibly also other inflammatory side effects but will need to be verified in human studies said immunotherapy expert james gulley m d ph d of nci s center for cancer research who was not involved in the study microbes and the immune system constant communication the immune system is constantly communicating with the skin microbiota dr belkaid said this two way dialogue can prevent harmful immune reactions and inflammation when the immune system encounters a new type of microbe on the skin that doesn t pose a threat mouse studies suggest that the skin microbiome helps educate the immune system to distinguish dangerous pathogens from beneficial or harmless microbes explained dermatologist heidi kong m d m h sc of the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases who was not involved in the new work studies in mice by dr belkaid s lab and others have also shown that some interactions between microbes and the immune system promote wound healing and protect against infection but under some circumstances these interactions can turn harmful the role of the skin microbiota in people is not as easy to study as it is in mice because exposures to skin bacteria are easier to control in mouse studies said dr kong but it s clear that if our skin were to have an inflammatory response to everything that it came into contact with including new microbes we d be walking around constantly inflamed she said immune checkpoint inhibitors disturb the peace dr belkaid s team wondered whether the skin side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors might be a consequence of the drug disrupting the normal dialogue between the skin microbiota and the immune system study details side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors the study examined the frequency timing and spectrum of chronic side effects from these drugs they began by treating lab mice with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab yervoy and applying staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria to the skin of these mice at the same time although s epidermidis is not normally found on mice previous work by dr belkaid s lab showed that these microbes can easily take up residence on the skin of mice and become a lifelong partner she said mice simultaneously treated with ipilimumab and exposed to s epidermidis developed striking skin inflammation the study team wrote by contrast when used on their own these treatments did not result in inflammation the inflamed mouse skin contained elevated levels of t cells the team found these t cells which specifically targeted s epidermidis produced a substance called il that can promote inflammation additional experiments indicated that excessive il secreted by the t cells was driving skin inflammation in the mice because the skin side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients may not appear until after treatment ends the team also looked at the long term consequences of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment they found that compared with their response to the initial exposure to s epidermidis mice that had been treated with ipilimumab had a stronger and more rapid inflammatory response to s epidermidis when they were re exposed to the bacteria a month after the initial exposure these re exposed mice also had increased numbers of memory t cells directed against the bacteria memory t cells can linger in the body to be quickly called up if a threat reappears the researchers concluded that immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment may lead to long term abnormal memory t cell responses in mice encountering the same microbe again even months after treatment with the drug has ended microbes cause pendulum to swing toward excess inflammation our study shows that in mice the peaceful relationship between the microbiota and the immune system can be profoundly affected by treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor dr belkaid said it raises the possibility that exposure to new microorganisms in the skin and other parts of the body such as the gut may lead to inflammation if checkpoint inhibitor treatment is started around the same time dr gulley said it s intriguing to see how in this mouse model you can cause the pendulum to swing toward too much inflammation in response to the skin microbiota dr kong said it would be interesting to see if the same effects occur in wild mice whose immune systems are more similar to the human immune system she added ultimately dr belkaid emphasized studies in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are needed to see if these findings in mice reflect what happens in humans the study s lead investigator z ian hu m d ph d a former nci clinical research fellow who is now at washington university in st louis hopes to pursue such research for instance the team wrote future studies could look at the composition of the skin microbiota in patients before and during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment to find out how changes in the microbiota influence the severity and development of skin side effects this study opens up a new series of questions that can form testable hypotheses dr gulley said another important question is whether the results apply to immune related side effects of checkpoint inhibitors in other organs besides skin such as inflammation of the colon colitis which is more serious than most skin side effects seen with the drugs it also remains to be seen whether similar effects are seen with other commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab keytruda and atezolizumab tecentriq which have different molecular targets than ipilimumab if the effects of immune checkpoint inhibition that dr belkaid s team observed in mice also occur in humans dr gulley said it may be possible to prevent or treat immune related

whether ensuring that people have a diverse microbiota before starting checkpoint inhibitor therapy could reduce the risk of immune related side effects by lessening the chances of acquiring new

by new findings from a large clinical trial could help doctors and patients select treatments for relapsed or treatment resistant ewing sarcoma a rare cancer that forms in bone and the soft tissue surrounding bone the trial included people with ewing sarcoma whose tumors did not shrink in response to their initial treatment or came back after that treatment in the study patients who received the chemotherapy drug ifosfamide ifex lived about months longer than those who received a combination of two other chemotherapy drugs topotecan and cyclophosphamide the new findings are from the first randomized phase clinical trial to compare commonly used chemotherapy regimens for recurrent ewing sarcoma such trials have been challenging to conduct in part because of the rarity of the disease which occurs most often in adolescents and young adults in the united states for example about people are diagnosed with the disease each year in the trial patients with ewing sarcoma that had recurred or stopped responding to treatment who received high doses of ifosfamide lived for a median of months versus months for those who received topotecan plus cyclophosphamide according to results from the reecur study the findings were reported at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting on june before the reecur study the basis for choosing drugs for patients with relapsed or refractory ewing sarcoma was weak said martin mccabe m d ph d of the university of manchester in the united kingdom who presented the results at the meeting with the new results doctors will have objective data from a randomized trial to use when talking with their patients about which treatments are most effective and or have the worst side effects he noted dr mccabe and his colleagues have evaluated four chemotherapy regimens over the course of the study which began as a phase trial the current study which is now a larger phase trial is still recruiting patients and has been collecting data on another regimen carboplatin plus etoposide this is an important and ambitious study said christine heske m d a sarcoma researcher in nci s pediatric oncology branch who was not involved in the trial the study attempted to define the most effective regimen for recurrent ewing sarcoma and has provided some useful data a potential new treatment option for some patients when the trial began in participants were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatment regimens topotecan plus cyclophosphamide irinotecan plus temozolomide gemcitabine plus docetaxel or high dose ifosfamide during this part of the study the patient groups receiving irinotecan plus temozolomide and gemcitabine plus docetaxel had lower tumor response rates than other patients according to findings reported in the researchers stopped recruiting patients to these treatment groups more research is needed to better understand how high dose ifosfamide compares with irinotecan plus temozolomide and with gemcitabine plus docetaxel according to dr heske she predicted however that doctors would now consider offering high dose ifosfamide to patients with recurrent or treatment resistant ewing sarcoma cancer research uk the european commission and the university of birmingham are sponsoring the trial an international effort in a rare disease most patients who have ewing sarcoma that has not spread from its original location in the body respond well to chemotherapy but for patients whose cancer does not respond to therapy or has come back after initial treatment the chance of survival is low the reecur study is focusing on this group of patients the data presented at the asco meeting was based on patients in the phase part of the study who ranged in age from to the researchers assessed overall survival as well as event free survival which is the amount of time after treatment begins that the patient is free of the cancer at a median follow up of months patients treated with ifosfamide had a median event free survival of months compared with months for patients who received topotecan plus cyclophosphamide both treatments led to similar rates of febrile neutropenia a condition that involves fever and a lower than normal number of white blood cells called neutrophils the condition occurred in about of patients in both groups ifosfamide was associated with serious side effects in the brain such as encephalopathy and the kidneys such as acute kidney disease although these were reported in less than of patients patients in the ifosfamide group were more likely than other patients to discontinue treatment due to side effects building on new findings during a discussion of the study results at the asco annual meeting dr mccabe said that differences in survival among the chemotherapy regimens were modest and that new treatments for the disease are needed clearly we need to do much better agreed katherine janeway m d who treats patients with ewing sarcoma at the dana farber cancer institute and discussed the reecur study at the meeting the abnormal protein driving ewing sarcoma in about of patients the ews fli fusion protein has been challenging to target with a drug dr janeway noted doctors have relied on chemotherapy because newer treatments such as immunotherapy have not been shown to be effective against the disease she added but research conducted by the fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers fusonc consortium which is supported by the cancer moonshot could reveal ways to overcome this challenge we re excited about some of the science emerging from the cancer moonshot dr janeway said meanwhile potential new treatments for ewing sarcoma including some targeted therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials the reecur results could help researchers conducting clinical trials select chemotherapy regimens to use as a backbone in combination with targeted therapies according to dr heske several new agents are currently in clinical testing or soon will be she said i think we may see some of these drugs added to an ifosfamide backbone older post enhertu improves survival for metastatic her low

april doi ijms cc by update on august the food and drug administration fda approved trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu for the treatment of her low breast cancers that can t be removed surgically or that have spread metastasized elsewhere in the body before receiving trastuzumab deruxtecan people must have either received one previous chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer or had their cancer return during or within months of completing chemotherapy given after surgery fda made its decision based on the results of the destiny breast trial which are described in the story below new clinical trial results could open the door to more effective treatments for about half of all people with metastatic breast cancer those whose tumors don t have high levels of the protein her who until now have had limited treatment options in the trial people with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with the her targeted drug trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu lived nearly twice as long without their cancer growing and lived months longer overall than those treated with standard chemotherapy all patients in the study had tumors classified as her low and had previously been treated for metastatic breast cancer with at least one other drug until now only people with breast cancers whose tumor cells produce high levels of her known as her positive breast cancer had been shown to benefit from drugs that target her but only about of people with breast cancer have her positive tumors the rest have no detectable her or low levels the newly designated her low form of metastatic breast cancer traditionally has been quite difficult to treat said breast cancer expert jane meisel m d of emory university s winship cancer institute who was not involved with the study what is her low breast cancer her low tumors are defined as those whose cells contain lower levels of the her protein on their surface these tumors account for about of all breast cancers a laboratory test called immunohistochemistry is used to determine whether her is present at low levels in a tissue biopsy in her positive breast cancer and in other cancers that overproduce her the excess her on tumor cells drives the cancer s growth the role of the her protein in her low tumors is still unclear tumors with low her levels have traditionally been classified as her negative because existing drugs that target her were not effective in treating them as a result until now her low cancers have been treated as if they were her negative the study findings are expected to change how metastatic her low breast cancer is treated and are a huge win for our patients dr meisel said at a press briefing held during the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting the findings also will fundamentally change the way breast cancers are classified in patients with metastatic disease she said alexandra zimmer m d of the women s malignancies branch in nci s center for cancer research who also was not involved with the study agreed that the findings are important and will provide a new treatment option for patients with metastatic her low breast cancer however dr zimmer noted some questions remain such as how the results will apply to other her targeted drugs available now or in the future study leader shanu modi m d of memorial sloan kettering cancer center presented the findings on june at the asco annual meeting in chicago trastuzumab deruxtecan also known as t dxd is the first her targeted therapy shown to provide clinically meaningful improvement in progression free and overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in people with her low metastatic breast cancer dr modi said at the meeting oncologists and cancer researchers at the meeting were so excited about the results which were published simultaneously in the new england journal of medicine that they gave dr modi a standing ovation drug delivers chemotherapy payload to tumor cells t dxd which is given by infusion into a vein is a type of drug known as an antibody drug conjugate such drugs consist of a monoclonal antibody in this case trastuzumab chemically linked to a cell killing chemotherapy drug in this case deruxtecan the trastuzumab component of t dxd acts as a homing device that helps the drug deliver its chemotherapy payload directly to tumor cells that have her on their surface the antibody drug conjugate is then ferried inside the cell where the attached chemotherapy drug is released and kills the cell once it s released the chemotherapy portion of t dxd can also enter and kill nearby tumor cells even those that have little or no her this unique bystander effect of t dxd is thought to be a key reason that the drug is effective against her low tumors whereas other drugs that target her are not dr modi said t dxd is already approved for the treatment of adults with advanced or metastatic her positive breast cancer who have previously been treated with other her targeted therapies based on results of the earlier destiny breast clinical trial other her targeted antibody drug conjugates in development are showing promise for treating her low breast cancer in early phase studies dr modi noted study participants had metastatic or inoperable breast cancer the clinical trial called destiny breast enrolled adults who had metastatic or inoperable her low breast cancer and had previously been treated with one or two types of chemotherapy nearly of participants had hormone receptor positive disease meaning their tumors had receptors for the hormones estrogen and or progesterone the trial was funded by the developers of t dxd daiichi sankyo and astrazeneca two thirds of participants were randomly assigned to receive t dxd and the rest to receive their doctor s choice of chemotherapy t dxd was given intravenously every weeks and patients were followed for a median of about months in the group that received t dxd the median time that people lived without their cancer getting worse known as progression free survival was about months compared with months in the chemotherapy group people who received t dxd survived for a median of months overall while those in the chemotherapy group survived for a median of months the numbers were similar when the researchers looked specifically at study participants who had hormone receptor positive disease although the study was not designed to look primarily at people with triple negative breast cancer that is those whose tumors lack hormone receptors as well as being her low preliminary evidence indicates that they did benefit from t dxd only of patients in destiny breast had this particularly aggressive and hard to treat form of breast cancer and we need more data and ideally a clinical trial specifically designed to answer this question dr zimmer said monitoring for potentially serious lung inflammation the rates of side effects seen with t dxd and chemotherapy were similar the most common severe side effects of t dxd were reduced levels of white and red blood cells and fatigue t dxd can also cause a potentially serious type of lung inflammation called interstitial lung disease in destiny breast people in the t dxd group about developed this side effect and died as a result by contrast only one person in the chemotherapy group developed this lung condition and it was mild ribociclib improves survival in advanced breast cancer used with letrozole drug is first to extend survival in large trial of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving t dxd must be carefully monitored and promptly treated if they develop signs of lung inflammation dr modi said because oncologists are already using t dxd to treat some women with breast cancer they are now more aware of this possible complication and know so much more about how to diagnose it earlier and how to treat it better said oncologist patricia lorusso d o ph d of yale cancer center who was not involved with the study this knowledge dr lorusso said has cut the rate of severe interstitial lung disease seen in people treated with t dxd since the drug first came into use a few years ago new methods of assessing her levels are needed with additional her targeted antibody drug conjugates expected to become available in the coming years we must also rethink novel more accurate and sensitive ways of assessing a tumor s her status dr lorusso said in formal comments after dr modi s presentation of the study findings she noted that a recent study found that pathologists did not always agree when it came to distinguishing between her low and her negative breast cancers using immunohistochemistry researchers are developing new tests that can detect lower her levels she said but these are not yet ready for use in everyday patient care we need to reevaluate how we classify the her content of tumors in terms of deciding what treatment to offer patients dr zimmer said and it s not clear yet what the lower end of the new her low designation will be she noted other issues for future study include figuring out how t dxd compares with other targeted drugs used to treat metastatic her low cancers such as those that block the activity of cdk and cdk proteins on cancer cells she said ideally clinical trials are needed to answer which one is best and clarify the order in which they should be offered to patients in addition dr lorusso said despite phenomenal and long lasting responses to t dxd metastatic breast cancer eventually does progress and it s important to understand why tumors stop responding ongoing clinical trials are looking at whether t dxd may be an effective treatment for breast cancer in its earlier stages and whether combining t dxd with other drugs may be more effective than using it by itself older post for some kids with brain cancer targeted therapy is better than chemo newer post ifosfamide may be treatment of choice for some people with ewing sarcoma

nci staff a liquid form of dabrafenib plus trametinib makes it much easier for young children with glioma to take the medicines credit istock some children with a type of brain cancer called low grade glioma may have a new standard treatment according to the results of a new clinical trial in the study the combination of dabrafenib tafinlar and trametinib mekinist was safer and better than standard chemotherapy at shrinking tumors and keeping them at bay all of the children in the study had a genetic mutation known as braf v in their cancer cells they also all had cancer that couldn t be removed by surgery or that had come back after surgery dabrafenib and trametinib are targeted therapies treatments that attack cancer cells with a specific gene or protein change dabrafenib targets cells with certain braf mutations and prevents the altered braf protein from sending growth signals trametinib blocks the activity of proteins that help send these signals there was a striking and significant difference in the outcomes of patients treated with targeted therapy and those treated with chemotherapy said the study s lead researcher eric bouffet m d of the hospital for sick children in toronto canada the targeted therapy combination shrank more patient s tumors and kept tumors at bay for nearly three times longer children treated with the targeted therapies also experienced fewer side effects including severe side effects dr bouffet presented the findings of the randomized phase trial on june at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting the results of this study are quite impressive and exciting for several reasons said melissa hudson m d a pediatric glioma expert from st jude children s research hospital who was not involved in the study one reason is that low grade gliomas are the most common brain tumors in kids dr hudson said during a presentation of the findings at the asco meeting and because of where gliomas grow in the brain they often can t be removed by surgery in addition chemotherapy causes health problems later in life for many children she explained so it s very exciting to have a targeted treatment that is safer and more effective than chemotherapy dr hudson said low grade glioma gliomas are tumors that grow in the brain or spinal cord when a child is diagnosed with glioma the tumor is given a grade low grade gliomas tend to grow and spread more slowly than high grade gliomas chemotherapy and radiation are the standard treatments for children with low grade glioma that can t be removed by surgery or that comes back after surgery while the vast majority to of kids with low grade glioma survive or more years after being diagnosed they may suffer from harsh long term side effects of the treatment such as nerve damage endocrine disorders learning disabilities and infertility it s important to try to identify treatments that minimize the long term treatment related late effects in survivors of low grade glioma said malcolm smith m d of nci s division of cancer treatment and diagnosis who was not involved in the study recent discoveries about the biology of gliomas have led to some new treatment ideas in particular studies have found that to of children with low grade glioma have a braf v mutation in their tumors leading to clinical trials of targeted therapies that block braf or proteins it works with in dr bouffet and his colleagues found that dabrafenib shrank the tumors of some children with low grade glioma around the same time large clinical trials showed that for adults with skin thyroid and lung cancer that had braf v mutations adding trametinib to dabrafenib was far more effective than dabrafenib alone so dr bouffet and his colleagues tested the combination in a small clinical trial of children with low grade glioma finding that the treatment was safe that then led to this larger trial the first ever randomized clinical trial of targeted treatment versus chemotherapy in pediatric patients with low grade glioma dr bouffet noted testing dabrafenib plus trametinib more than children with low grade glioma ages to were involved in the study novartis the manufacturer of dabrafenib and trametinib funded the study combination therapy approved for tumors with braf mutation dabrafenib tafinlar plus trametinib mekinist are approved for advanced solid tumors with braf v e mutations the participants were randomly assigned to receive either dabrafenib and trametinib or the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin and vincristine if a participant s cancer got worse while taking chemotherapy they had the option of switching to the targeted therapy combination dr bouffet explained both targeted therapies are typically taken as pills but for this study a new liquid form was used making it much easier for younger children to take the medicines dr bouffet said tumors responded meaning they shrank or disappeared completely in of patients in the targeted therapy group and just of those in the chemotherapy group the targeted therapy combination also kept patients tumors at bay for longer a median of months versus months among children in the chemotherapy group safer than chemotherapy among patients taking dabrafenib and trametinib the most common side effects were fever headache and vomiting dr bouffet described these side effects as manageable fewer patients in the targeted therapy group than in the chemotherapy group had a serious side effect versus or stopped treatment due to side effects versus the research team is continuing to monitor the long term safety of the targeted therapy treatment dr bouffet noted targeted therapies like dabrafenib and trametinib have the potential for reducing the long term effects of treatment but children who have received dabrafenib and trametinib need to be monitored for years to confirm that this is the case said dr smith dr hudson said she is hopeful that the targeted therapy approach will turn out to be safer in the long run this type of targeted therapy will enable us to personalize treatment for these children and hopefully improve the quality of their survival long term she said only for tumors with braf mutations it s very important to note that this is not a treatment for all patients with low grade glioma dr bouffet emphasized it only applies to children with a braf v mutation in their tumor a type of genetic testing known as biomarker or molecular testing can reveal if a braf mutation is present in a patient s glioma this study demonstrates how important it is for children with low grade glioma to get biomarker testing as soon as possible after being diagnosed dr bouffet said in march nci launched the molecular characterization initiative a program that offers biomarker testing to young patients with central nervous system tumors including glioma testing is available to patients getting care at a hospital affiliated with the children s oncology group for more information visit the molecular characterization initiative s website targeted therapy for high grade glioma other findings from the same study suggest that the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib may also be effective for children with high grade glioma the study included patients with high grade glioma that had come back after initial treatment and had a braf v mutation all of the participants received the targeted therapy combination tumors shrank or disappeared completely for of participants and in these patients didn t grow again for a median of months in comparison standard treatments for high grade glioma typically shrink tumors in less than of patients overall participants tumors didn t progress for a median of months and half of all participants were alive nearly years later typically less than of children with high grade glioma live more than years after diagnosis said the lead scientist darren hargrave m d of the great ormond street hospital for children in london older post fda

estimated million people in the united states aged and older smoked menthol cigarettes a disproportionate number of whom were youths young adults and african americans credit national cancer institute menthol cigarettes could soon be prohibited in the united states if new tobacco product standards proposed by the food and drug administration fda are finalized and take effect prohibiting menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes is expected to make them less appealing reducing diseases and deaths caused by cigarette smoking tobacco control researchers say this proposed change could have the greatest impact on youth and african american smokers who smoke menthol cigarettes at a far higher rate than other smokers fda also proposed a rule prohibiting all characterizing flavors e g grape cotton candy except tobacco flavoring in cigars to help curb their appeal the proposed rules announced on april are open for public comment through august this is a very large public health step said priscilla callahan lyon m d senior science advisor in fda s center for tobacco products if finalized this rule will make the manufacturing and sale of menthol cigarettes illegal in the united states combined with continued efforts at prevention and cessation these actions will have significant public health benefits the proposed rule aligns with the biden administration s cancer moonshot goal of reducing deaths from cancer by at least over the next years dr callahan lyon said smoking is estimated to account for of all cancer deaths in the united states this is one of the most important opportunities we ve had in tobacco control in a long time said michele bloch m d ph d chief of nci s tobacco control research branch we anticipate that once menthol cigarettes are prohibited there will be fewer adolescents and young adults who initiate smoking and go on to become regular smokers dr bloch said and we think a substantial portion of african american smokers will take this opportunity to quit the evidence against menthol tobacco manufacturers add menthol to cigarettes to provide users with a cooling sensation that masks the irritation and harshness of smoking menthol also interacts with nicotine in the brain to enhance the addictiveness of nicotine making it harder for people to quit smoking explained rachel grana mayne ph d a program director in nci s tobacco control research branch in the proposed rule fda noted that in an estimated million people in the united states aged and older smoked menthol cigarettes a disproportionate number of whom were youths young adults and african americans menthol cigarettes are often the first cigarette that youth and young adults try dr grana mayne said prohibiting these products will reduce smoking s appeal to youth and young adults and is expected to decrease the likelihood that they will continue to experiment with and use cigarettes the tobacco industry has aggressively targeted menthol cigarettes to the african american community for many decades dr callahan lyon said that has contributed to the heavy use of menthol cigarettes by african americans who smoke and why disease and death caused by menthol cigarettes falls heavily on this community she explained one nci supported study estimated that although of the us general population is african american they made up of premature deaths from menthol cigarettes between and in as part of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act congress banned all flavored cigarettes except for menthol however congress charged fda s tobacco products scientific advisory committee with reviewing the scientific evidence on the harms of menthol in cigarettes and making a recommendation to fda in july the committee issued a report concluding that removing menthol cigarettes from the market would benefit public health in the united states shortly after fda s center for tobacco products conducted its own evaluation of the available science on the public health impact of menthol cigarettes their analysis concluded that menthol cigarettes are likely associated with numerous problems including increasing the number of people who start smoking and progress to regular smoking and a lower likelihood of quitting smoking particularly among african americans since then fda has continued to evaluate menthol s effects on smoking including initiation and cessation we have come to the conclusion that we have enough science to support prohibiting menthol in cigarettes said dr callahan lyon research funded and conducted by nci played an important role in building the evidence base for the proposed rules dr bloch said lessons from other countries evidence from menthol bans around the world informed fda s proposed rule dr callahan lyon said in for example an expert group convened by the world health organization found that youth who regularly smoked menthol cigarettes had a harder time quitting than youth who smoked nonmenthol cigarettes the report recommended that countries ban the use of menthol and related flavorings in cigarettes and possibly all tobacco products many countries have done just that dr bloch said the preponderance of evidence from published studies indicates that a ban on menthol cigarettes would profoundly decrease smoking rates said geoffrey t fong ph d of the university of waterloo one nci funded study for example showed that after canadian health authorities banned menthol cigarettes people who primarily smoked menthol cigarettes were more likely to quit smoking than nonmenthol cigarette smokers extrapolating these findings to the united states the researchers estimated that a us prohibition on menthol cigarettes could lead to more than million us smokers quitting with a large proportion of them being african american a similar study looking at outcomes of a menthol cigarette ban in england found that the number of youth who smoked menthol cigarettes declined substantially after the ban took effect a ban on menthol cigarettes in the united states would be a landmark policy that s likely to lead to tremendous public health benefits including reductions in cancer said dr fong who led the canadian study anything we can do to get smokers to quit is going to lead to reductions in the overall burden of the number one preventable cause of cancer beefing up prevention and cessation resources helping people quit smoking is the best way to ensure that these rules have maximum benefit for public health dr callahan lyon said so fda is working with other federal partners to make sure the support is there for those who are trying to stop other organizations such as the african american tobacco control leadership council aatcl have led efforts across the united states to prohibit menthol and other flavored tobacco products valerie yerger n d of the university of california san francisco and an aatcl cofounder said that for the ban to have the biggest impact resources from the federal government need to be accompanied by efforts at the state local and community levels if you don t have boots on the ground at the community level then you don t have anybody countering the persistent marketing by the tobacco industry dr yerger said dr yerger also noted the need for investments to address the underlying barriers that contributed to people smoking how do we alleviate the inequities that are driving people to smoke she asked dr grana mayne agreed noting that there is a window of opportunity to make sure smoking cessation programs are easily accessible with adequate resources and few barriers to their use the reality is that the communities that are at highest risk and most likely to be affected by prohibiting menthol cigarettes often have limited resources available to them she continued we need to ensure that people can get help quitting smoking when they decide that they need it and without any barriers at all nci offers free evidence based resources to help people quit smoking dr bloch said nci s smokefree gov for example offers a suite of smoking cessation resources such as text messaging programs that offer support and articles on how to handle the challenges of quitting smoking no time to waste fda held public listening sessions in june to hear from affected communities after the public comment period for the proposed rules ends the agency will review the comments and decide what if any changes should be made to the proposed rules dr callahan lyon explained based on the comments fda receives the agency may decide to end the rulemaking process issue a new proposed rule s or issue a final rule s fda is currently proposing that any final rule would become effective year after it is published she said in the meantime it s important to continue focusing on prevention and cessation dr callahan lyon noted most people who smoke regret ever starting she said they smoke because they re addicted what we need to do is to make it easier for them to quit older post active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer continues to rise newer post for some kids with brain cancer targeted therapy is better than

staff until about years ago most men diagnosed with prostate cancer that has a low risk of causing death had immediate treatment with surgery or radiation although both are considered to be cures for low risk prostate cancer they can also have serious and lifelong side effects including urinary problems and erectile dysfunction but a recent study confirms findings from earlier studies that found men are increasingly opting against immediate treatment instead they are working with their doctors to carefully monitor the cancer via a process known as active surveillance holding off on treatment until there are signs of progression overall the study which included data from urology practices across the country found that about of us men diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer are now being managed with active surveillance in fact the rates of active surveillance more than doubled between and the time period covered by the study the finding is encouraging and shows that the use of active surveillance is headed in the right direction said the study s lead investigator matt cooperberg m d of the university of california san francisco ucsf who reported the findings on may at the american urological association s aua annual meeting but they are still not where they need to be of particular concern dr cooperberg noted is the finding that in some urology practices only a small percentage of patients with low risk prostate cancer are on active surveillance there were urologists in some practices who did not have a single patient with low risk disease on active surveillance those findings fly in the face of recommendations from leading medical groups that say active surveillance is the preferred approach for men diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer those doctors are doing their patients a disservice said howard parnes m d chief of the prostate and urologic cancer research group in nci s division of cancer prevention who was not involved in the study if a patient meets the criteria for low risk disease active surveillance needs to be a central part of the conversation reconsidering immediate treatment most prostate cancers diagnosed with psa based screening which became widespread in the united states starting in the early s are low risk generally speaking that means they are small confined to the prostate and not considered to be aggressive according to a common grading system known as the gleason score nevertheless throughout the s and well into the s many men diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer had immediate treatment with surgery or radiation what is low risk prostate cancer according to the most recent guidelines from the aua and national comprehensive cancer network nccn low risk prostate cancers are those that meet these criteria psa level of less than gleason grade group gleason score clinical stage t t a learn more about psa testing gleason grade groups and clinical staging nccn also has a very low risk category for which active surveillance is also recommended but even in the early days of widespread psa screening questions were raised about whether these screen detected cancers were actually dangerous studies followed that echoed those concerns concluding that many of these cancers would likely never grow to the point where they would even cause symptoms let alone become life threatening another alternative to immediate treatment is watchful waiting simply waiting for symptoms before pursuing any further testing or treatment but because prostate cancer can be deadly once it spreads beyond the prostate use of watchful waiting in men with low risk prostate cancer has been limited protocols for active surveillance were first proposed in the mid s and have since been studied and implemented in various forms it s only fairly recently that leading medical organizations felt the data on the safety of active surveillance were strong enough to formally recommend it as the preferred approach for men with low risk disease how is active surveillance done although the protocol can vary recommendations for active surveillance generally call for routine psa tests and prostate biopsies to check for any indication that the cancer might be growing for example patients at montefiore health system in new york city get a psa test every months at least initially and an mri guided biopsy a year after diagnosis said kara watts m d a urologist at the hospital who specializes in treating prostate cancer but was not involved in the study after the initial psa tests and biopsy how often they are performed depends largely on the patient s particular situation dr watts explained we have a flexible protocol particularly for people at both ends of the age spectrum she continued for a man in his s and a life expectancy of years based on other health conditions and other factors she said additional psa tests or biopsies may only be conducted every few years or only if he has symptoms an otherwise healthy man in his s on the other hand will usually continue to have psa tests and mri guided biopsies on a schedule similar to the initial protocol at the nih clinical center where dr parnes sees patients in addition to routine psa testing mri guided biopsies are used to help inform decisions around whether to pursue active surveillance and as part of the surveillance protocol mri guided biopsies have been shown to improve the detection of intermediate and high grade prostate cancer but they aren t required for active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer dr parnes explained many studies using standard ultrasound guided biopsies have demonstrated the long term safety of active surveillance in men with low risk prostate cancer he said genetic and molecular testing are also making their way into doctors decisions to recommend active surveillance and as part of the surveillance protocol at nci for example men with a family history of cancer or who are diagnosed with intermediate risk prostate cancer are recommended to undergo testing for mutations in the brca gene or other genes involved repairing damaged dna dr parnes said finally regardless of the doctor or hospital where a patient is being treated if biopsy results suggest that the cancer grade is progressing men will generally be advised to receive immediate treatment the number of men on active surveillance who eventually get treated with surgery or radiation varies in a recent large observational study involving over men just under half of those on active surveillance received definitive treatment within years more active surveillance but not enough to conduct their study dr cooperberg and his colleagues looked at data from all men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer in the aua quality registry this registry collects real time data from more than participating us urology practices and more than urologists overall of the more than patients covered by the study were diagnosed with low risk disease the number of men diagnosed with low risk disease actually fell during the study period from about in to in that finding is consistent with other recent studies showing a decline in low risk diagnoses which researchers have attributed to fewer men being screened via psa testing but even as diagnoses of low risk disease have dropped more men with low risk disease are opting for active surveillance dr cooperberg reported in of men with low risk prostate cancer chose active surveillance by the end of did rates of active surveillance also increased among men diagnosed with intermediate risk prostate cancer which is considered to have a modestly greater likelihood than low risk prostate cancer of progressing to the point where it could be fatal the steady uptick is welcome news dr cooperberg said but he also highlighted the relatively extreme variation in the use of active surveillance across the country the researchers found that rates of active surveillance for men with low risk prostate cancer can range from to nearly by urology practice he said and depending on which individual doctor s door you knock on even within a given practice rates range from to the variability in the use of active surveillance is alarming dr parnes said it likely reflects at least to some degree entrenched patterns of care among some urologists for some i suspect their feeling is i treat cancer and this is cancer i m not having this conversation about active surveillance he said dr watts agreed it s likely that some doctors just aren t discussing active surveillance or they re portraying it in a way that biases patients toward definitive treatment she said exceptions and barriers to active surveillance in his ucsf program dr cooperberg said about of men diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer are put on active surveillance as an academic center that began implementing and studying active surveillance in the mid s that s likely higher than what is typically seen in the united states he acknowledged but a reasonable target for the time being is around he said that s consistent with where rates top out in countries like sweden and in other large integrated health care systems in europe where active surveillance has long been standard practice the bottom line dr cooperberg said is that even though the vast majority of men with low risk prostate cancer should be put on active surveillance there will always be exceptions those exceptions for example can include men with a strong family history of prostate cancer or who have urological symptoms related to the disease that immediate treatment can help to alleviate there can also be considerations that go beyond clinical or biological factors for patients in rural areas or those who lack reliable transportation anything that requires regular visits to the hospital or doctor s office over a long period could push some men toward choosing immediate treatment dr watts said in addition she noted it can be challenging to explain the medical basis for active surveillance in some patient s minds opting for active surveillance means missing a window of opportunity for cure she said the c word is scary for a lot of people dr watts continued and in this case a lot of the art of medicine is being able to explain why active surveillance is appropriate older post new way to classify meningioma

by nci staff the pattern of dna methylation in a meningioma tumor may reveal important information such as the chances of the tumor growing back after treatment credit national cancer institute created with biorender com two separate but complementary studies have found a new way to classify meningioma a type of tumor that forms in the outer covering of the brain the new grouping system may help predict whether a patient s tumor will grow back recur after treatment it also has the potential to reveal what s causing tumor growth and identify treatment ideas according to the scientists who led the studies the standard way of classifying meningioma is based on the appearance of the tumor cells under a microscope but the new approach focuses on molecular changes inside the tumor cells more specifically both studies looked at chemical marks on dna what s known as dna methylation dna methylation is a type of epigenetic change that fine tunes gene activity the researchers identified several groups of meningiomas with distinct patterns of dna methylation these groupings turned out to reflect the chance of tumor recurrence after treatment what s more tumors in each group had similar biological features the scientists found that knowledge in turn revealed a few potential treatment options including cell cycle inhibitors and a drug that targets epigenetic changes both studies converged on similar findings with some minor variations said kenneth aldape m d of nci s center for cancer research who along with gelareh zadeh m d ph d of the university of toronto led one of the studies that overlap shows that dna methylation is a powerful way to classify meningiomas added dr aldape whose study was published august in nature despite the fact that meningioma is the most common brain tumor it s been rather understudied in part because there is a pervasive misconception that meningiomas are benign said david raleigh m d ph d of the university of california san francisco who led the other study which appeared may in nature genetics but that s not doing justice to all the meningioma patients out there he said around to of meningiomas are aggressive and potentially deadly current meningioma treatments fall short for decades meningiomas have been grouped into tumor grades based on the way the tumor tissue looks under a microscope including how quickly the tumor cells appear to be growing grade tumors grow slowly grade tumors grow quickly and grade tumors are somewhere in between and although grade tumors grow more slowly they can push on the brain causing changes in eyesight hearing smell strength or other issues doctors use the tumor grade its location in the brain and other factors to determine how aggressive the tumor is and to decide what the best treatment is while this grading system is useful it can be imprecise dr aldape said some grade tumors come back after treatment whereas some grade tumors don t he explained and tumor grading doesn t give any insight into what s driving the growth of a patient s tumor dr raleigh added so a more informative way of classifying meningioma is needed he said new treatment options are also desperately needed both researchers stressed currently the only options for meningioma are surgery and radiation but tumors that are close to major nerves or structures can t be removed by surgery and if a tumor grows back or gets worse after surgery and or radiation there are no effective treatments only half of all people with grade or meningiomas live for more than years after being diagnosed tumor groups that predict recurrence both sets of researchers analyzed dna methylation patterns in tumor samples previously collected from hundreds of people with meningiomas they then identified groups of tumors with distinct patterns of dna methylation in both studies the researchers found that these groupings reflected the chance of the tumor growing back after initial treatment in other words certain tumor methylation groups had a low chance of tumor recurrence while others had a high chance of recurrence the scientists then defined the key biological features of each tumor group by layering in additional data on dna mutations rna levels and protein levels in the tumor samples both studies found that one tumor group called benign nf wildtype in one study and merlin intact in the other had at least one normal copy of a gene called nf which makes a protein called merlin additional cell and mouse experiments by dr raleigh s group suggest that merlin prompts meningioma cells to self destruct upon chemotherapy or radiation treatment that may be one reason why people with tumors of this group have a low chance of recurrence dr raleigh explained another tumor group immunogenic immune enriched was marked by an influx of immune cells both studies showed but the immune cells didn t appear to be killing the tumor cells instead dr raleigh and his colleagues found that t cells in these tumors were run down or exhausted they also saw that immune enriched meningiomas had more lymph vessels structures that ferry immune cells around the body although immunotherapy is being explored as a treatment option for meningioma these findings suggest that immunotherapy might not work for patients with immunogenic immune enriched meningioma dr raleigh noted a third tumor group hypermitotic proliferative had genetic and epigenetic changes that led to nonstop cell division both studies found these tumors had the highest chance of recurrence dr aldape and his colleagues also identified a fourth tumor group hypermetabolic that have a high chance of recurrence and have increased activity of genes that control cell metabolism findings lead to new treatment ideas both studies uncovered potential treatment approaches for specific groups of meningiomas the team led by drs aldape and zadeh zeroed in on vorinostat zolinza a drug that reverses certain epigenetic alterations and is used to treat lymphoma in the lab vorinostat killed human meningioma cells in the proliferative group but not in the other groups and in mice the drug slowed the growth of proliferative tumors meanwhile dr raleigh and his colleagues tested several cell cycle inhibitors drugs that block cell division and are used to treat breast cancer in lab studies these inhibitors killed immune enriched and hypermitotic meningioma cells grown in the lab in mini brain organoids and in human tumors implanted into mice they found given these results dr raleigh s team offered abemaciclib verzenio a cell cycle inhibitor to three people with recurrent hypermitotic meningiomas who had run out of treatment options the tumors would not leave these patients alone they kept coming back despite tons of surgery and radiotherapy dr raleigh explained abemaciclib shrank the tumors of all three patients one of the patients was blind in her right eye and had started to experience blurred vision in her left eye as her tumor got worse we started her on abemaciclib and to our delight her vision came back in her left eye and her tumor got smaller when nothing had shrunk it for years dr raleigh said they have treated several more patients with abemaciclib he added dr raleigh and his colleagues at the university of california san francisco are developing a clinical trial of abemaciclib for people with meningioma and a handful of clinical trials evaluating cell cycle inhibitors in people with meningioma are already ongoing he noted sharing new knowledge neither research team is wasting any time sharing and applying their findings dr aldape and his colleagues have been analyzing dna methylation profiles for people around the country with hard to treat meningioma here at nih we re routinely using dna methylation profiling not just for meningiomas but for all brain tumors he said dna methylation for meningiomas people with a confirmed diagnosis of a rare brain or spine tumor including meningioma can participate in the nci connect clinic which offers tumor dna methylation testing please contact the nci connect team meanwhile dr raleigh s group has developed a free meningioma classifier app when a doctor or researcher plugs a patient s dna methylation profile into the app it tells them what methylation group the tumor falls into in addition both studies have created a treasure trove of data for scientists to continue exploring that was part of the motivation for their study dr aldape said perhaps even more clues about meningioma biology and new treatment ideas are

subscribe june by nci staff as the number of cancer survivors grows addressing their psychological and social concerns will become even more urgent credit istock the impact of cancer and its treatment is undeniably stressful and although many people recover well about of cancer survivors have persistent problems including anxiety depression and other psychological and social psychosocial distress in this interview patricia ganz m d of ucla s jonsson comprehensive cancer center discusses psychosocial distress in cancer survivors and the challenges and opportunities in this area dr ganz has dedicated much of her career to the study of cancer survivorship she was on the institute of medicine now the national academies committee that published the report cancer care for the whole patient meeting psychosocial health needs do you get the impression that most clinicians think about the mental health needs of cancer survivors most clinicians would like to be thinking about these things however in the usual short follow up visits the appointment is more focused on a patient s physical symptoms and what needs to be done to follow up on the cancer so often the topic of a person s mental health needs does not come up unless the patient is very anxious or looks depressed this is especially true for people who have had more intense or complex cancer treatment where their physical symptoms and the need for follow up tend to drive the conversation however patients want to know how they can manage their health after cancer including their mental health often the emotional impact of the cancer diagnosis and treatment does not crop up until months or a year after treatment ends from the outside a patient may appear to have fully recovered but in fact they are suffering inside how can clinicians who see cancer survivors address their patients mental health concerns patricia ganz m d director of cancer prevention and control research jonsson comprehensive cancer center if the physician or member of the health care team said something like we know that recovering from this both physically and emotionally will be difficult please let us know if you have had an increase in physical or emotional problems since your cancer diagnosis we re here for you we can make referrals and there are lots of resources that can help you cope with both the physical and emotional aftereffects of cancer if an oncologist has been through treatment with thousands of patients and knows the spectrum of issues that can arise why not share that with the patient so they know what to expect what are the biggest challenges when it comes to mental health care for cancer survivors one of the challenges we face is the stigma in our society of asking for anything that is related to mental health care services in addition some survivors may come from cultures where looking for help of this type may be unfamiliar another challenge is that we tend to have silos of care due to the specialized nature of modern medicine things would be a lot easier if we could integrate psychosocial support as part of care and not view it as something separate and having a clinician who is attentive to the whole person the mind as well as the body can help over the past years my colleagues and i have shown how cancer treatment can affect the brain for example by causing inflammation our stress hormones are in high gear when we re going through cancer treatment in addition we ve found that adversity during childhood such as abuse and neglect can gear up your stress hormones from an early age to respond to any threat including the cancer experience in an intensified way most oncologists don t appreciate that before a person has ever had cancer there s possibly been a slate written for how their mind and body respond to stress and now you re throwing lots of potentially toxic treatments at them that increase inflammation which will engage with a person s preexisting stress responses are there one or two of these challenges or barriers that would be easiest to address cancer survivorship webinar series nci s office of cancer survivorship ocs hosts the ocs director s series of webinars these webinars examine research on the physical psychological social and economic effects of cancer and its treatment watch the presentation by dr ganz for an update on the institute of medicine report cancer care for the whole patient there are short questionnaires such as the phq that screen for anxiety and depression are easy to use in clinic and could pick up seriously troubled people with just two questions each on anxiety and depression but unless you can respond to those problems and connect people with tools and services to help them cope you haven t done very much for the person there are many different things such as tai chi yoga and mindfulness meditation that will help with both the physical and mental aftereffects of cancer you don t even have to ask someone directly if they are depressed you can ask about mood sadness and symptoms that may be indicators of depression such as fatigue trouble falling asleep and trouble concentrating these things are quite common among cancer survivors and they will affect a person s well being or quality of life and how they re recovering even if the person does not meet the criteria for being depressed if clinicians prefer not to use a written or electronic questionnaire they can ask questions from it and then find out how to address those problems are there challenges or barriers to providing psychosocial support for survivors that are more difficult to address i think there is a fear among clinicians that if you start to look for mental health issues among patients you would be opening a can of worms and that addressing anxiety and depression would take too much time but in fact a recent study of people with breast cancer led by erin hahn ph d m p h at kaiser permanente southern california found that fewer than of people who were screened for depression in community based oncology practices met the criteria for needing a special care referral assessing quality of life for ayas with cancer a task force will help gather patient reported outcomes from adolescents and young adults in cancer clinical trials screening tells the patient that you care about this part of their experience it also says if you have some problems in the future we can find someone to help you and for those who are struggling now there s an acknowledgment that this is one of the issues that people may face when they have cancer nci and others have supported a lot of high quality research in this area but the type of care that is needed is not getting delivered any kind of behavioral or psychosocial health service such as psychotherapy or mindfulness training is just not part of general medical care and these services are not routinely billable by oncologists or community cancer clinics because of the way our health insurance system is set up however i m hopeful that this may change because many insurance plans are realizing that persistent mental health issues can lead to the consumption of extra resources for example dr hahn and her colleagues showed that in clinics that screened for depressive symptoms and referred patients who needed help to a behavioral health specialist there was a decrease in oncology visits this is not entirely surprising because patients who are worried or anxious often come back to see their doctor more frequently for adolescents and young adults ages are there specific issues that you feel are a particularly high priority to address screening for psychological distress and providing mental health care must be the number two priority after treating the cancer i regularly have young adults referred to me who have gone through arduous treatment and when i screen them for depression they are off the charts sometimes it s due to other life experiences from before they had the cancer but other times it s because their lives have been derailed by having cancer are there specific things that you see as a higher priority to address regarding the psychosocial well being of cancer survivors managing anxiety and distress in cancer survivors researchers are exploring ways to support survivors mental health needs some professional organizations have endorsed screening all cancer patients and survivors for psychosocial distress which is important but screening alone is not enough you have to be able to link people to the many evidence based highly effective psychosocial services that nci research has funded studying how to implement and disseminate these kinds of services is critical and that s where the rubber hits the road my passion now is to find the most effective way to get the tools and strategies that we know can work to the people who need them we also need to figure out how to normalize the provision of psychosocial health services as part of high quality cancer care clinicians need to have a menu of treatment options available and if one strategy doesn t work for somebody or if they don t like it and don t want to use it there s another strategy to try but we can t give up and say it s too difficult to meet the psychosocial health needs of cancer survivors older post more evidence

subscribe june by nci staff conducted in kenya the ken she trial is part of a global effort to make hpv vaccines more accessible around the world credit istock new results from a study in kenya add to growing evidence that a single dose of human papillomavirus hpv vaccine is highly effective in protecting young women against cervical infection with cancer causing hpv types certain types of hpv cause almost all cases of cervical cancer vaccines that protect against these hpv types can greatly reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer as well as other cancers caused by long lasting hpv infections but globally hpv vaccination rates are low especially in countries with high rates of cervical cancer and limited health care resources giving just one hpv vaccine dose instead of the two or three doses currently recommended would reduce the cost and simplify the logistics of vaccination which could allow more girls worldwide to be vaccinated said aim e kreimer ph d of nci s division of cancer epidemiology and genetics the new findings are from the ken she study a randomized clinical trial comparing hpv infection rates in girls and young women ages who received a single dose of hpv vaccine with rates in those who received a meningitis vaccine and months later received an hpv vaccine the trial is part of a global effort by researchers to make hpv vaccines more accessible to girls around the world said dr kreimer she leads several nci sponsored hpv vaccine clinical trials in costa rica in collaboration with agencia costarricense de investigaciones biom dicas in the ken she trial a single dose of either of two hpv vaccines provided protection against new persistent infections with hpv and the two hpv types that cause about of all cervical cancers reported the study s principal investigator ruanne barnabas m d ph d chief of infectious diseases at massachusetts general hospital and her colleagues the results were published april in nejm evidence along with earlier findings from observational studies including those from an extended follow up of the costa rica hpv vaccine trial and recent results from a study in india the ken she results have moved us another step closer to the important goal of increasing the accessibility of hpv vaccines dr kreimer said and more data are coming from other studies that we hope will take us the rest of the way low global rates of hpv vaccination cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women in low and middle income countries including in sub saharan africa most new cases of cervical cancer worldwide about half a million each year occur in these countries as do almost of cervical cancer deaths one motivation for conducting the ken she study dr barnabas said was a visit she and the study s co principal investigator nelly mugo m d m p h of the kenya medical research institute kemri made to the cervical cancer ward at a hospital in nairobi we ve had the hpv vaccine since and we could have prevented those women from developing cervical cancer she said hpv vaccination can prevent infection with hpv types that cause most cervical cancers because hpv is transmitted sexually vaccine programs generally aim to vaccinate girls and younger adolescents study confirms hpv vaccine prevents cervical cancer a large study of vaccinated females showed a nearly reduction in cervical cancer however in only about of adolescent girls worldwide had received two doses of hpv vaccine and that rate fell to during the covid pandemic said dr barnabas who was at the university of washington at the time the ken she study was being conducted many low resource countries do not have hpv vaccination programs or the health infrastructure to offer routine cervical cancer screening and rates of hpv vaccination in many countries that do have ready access to the vaccines including the united states remain less than optimal looking at the protection from one hpv vaccine dose health officials in kenya had planned a national hpv vaccination program for to year old girls however due to limited supply the vaccine has been made available only to year old girls although some girls up to age may eventually be able to get vaccinated hpv vaccination is not provided for those and older in kenya dr barnabas said these women who are just older than years have decades of life ahead of them so we wanted to test whether a single hpv vaccine dose could reduce their risk of acquiring hpv she continued vaccination provides the most benefit if a person has not yet been infected with one or more of the high risk hpv types targeted by the vaccines the ken she trial which was primarily funded by the bill melinda gates foundation enrolled girls and young women ages years at three sites in kenya participants needed to be sexually active but with no more than five lifetime partners hiv negative and not previously vaccinated against hpv just over of participants reported having had only one lifetime sexual partner participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups one group received a single dose of the bivalent hpv vaccine cervarix which prevents infection with hpv and a second group received one dose of the nonavalent hpv vaccine gardasil which protects against hpv and five other cancer causing or high risk hpv types a third group received a vaccine that protects against meningococcal disease a common cause of bacterial meningitis in teens and young adults dr barnabas s team had originally planned to give all participants in the meningococcal vaccine group one of the hpv vaccines at the end of the study years after enrollment however she said once it became clear after months of follow up that a single dose of hpv vaccine was protective the girls and young women in this group received an hpv vaccine both hpv vaccines sharply reduced risk of infection at enrollment participants were tested for hpv infections of the cervix during the study participants received regular hpv testing and pap tests they also were offered sexual and reproductive health services including family planning and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections including hiv the primary outcome of the study was vaccine efficacy that is the incidence of new persistent infections with an hpv type targeted by the vaccine at months participants who within the first months of the study did not yet have an hpv infection with one or more of the hpv types targeted by the vaccine were included in this analysis those who were infected with any of these hpv types in the first months remained in the study and all women with an abnormal pap test are being followed until their infection clears or they receive treatment dr barnabas said at months after enrollment of women who received the meningococcal vaccine control group had a new persistent cervical hpv infection compared with only of women who received one of the two hpv vaccines the efficacy of both vaccines against hpv was the ken she team is continuing to follow all participants for a total of years to see how long the protection against hpv infection lasts more data to come on single dose vaccination longer term data from the ken she trial and from other randomized clinical trials involving younger girls will become available over the coming years and will aim to answer questions about the durability of single dose hpv vaccination and to determine how one dose compares to two doses dr kreimer said current evidence that a single dose of hpv vaccine is as effective as two or three doses comes from previous studies that were not specifically designed to investigate the efficacy of one dose but in which some participants ended up receiving only a single dose one trial specifically testing whether one dose is as effective as two doses is the nci sponsored escuddo trial in costa rica which dr kreimer leads results from escuddo are expected in she said another important study the doris trial is taking place in tanzania dr kreimer said this trial is studying the immune response to see how one two and three doses of the bivalent and nonavalent hpv vaccines work in young girls the trial will indirectly assess the protection that vaccination provides by comparing the immune response in young girls in tanzania to the immune response in participants in the ken she trial and the costa rica and india studies she explained results are expected this year meanwhile on april a world health organization who advisory group issued a provisional recommendation to update hpv vaccine schedules to one or two doses for most girls and young women years old based on results of the ken she trial and other emerging evidence a final recommendation is expected in june who has set a goal of vaccinating of girls worldwide against hpv by age by in addition in february a united kingdom advisory committee on vaccination issued an interim recommendation to change the hpv vaccination schedule from two doses to one in the uk s routine vaccination program for adolescents up to age stakeholders in ken she trial shared common agenda the ken she trial was designed in close collaboration with the kenyan ministry of health kemri and other study partners dr barnabas said in addition an outside group the institute for ethics and policy innovation at mcmaster university conducted a formal ethics review all the stakeholders in the ken she study had the same agenda with the outcome being increased access to hpv vaccination throughout the world she said that includes here in the united states where there continue to be disparities in access to hpv vaccines and a single dose of a highly effective hpv vaccine could yield the same benefits as were seen in kenya she noted that in australia where a universal hpv vaccination program has sharply reduced infection with cancer causing hpv types they will probably eliminate cervical cancer by meanwhile we have of the burden of cervical cancer in low

study in mice suggests that a ketone called bhb can slow the growth of abnormal cells in the colon and colon cancer cells credit national cancer institute your diet and your colon have an intimate relationship molecules broken down from food and drink continuously bathe the cells that line the intestines it s these cells called epithelial cells that give rise to the most common type of colorectal cancer this relationship has sparked decades of research into diet and colorectal cancer risk in a new study in mice researchers have found evidence that a compound produced while eating a ketogenic diet that is a diet very high in fat and low in carbohydrates could inhibit the development of colorectal cancer the compound called hydroxybutyrate bhb jump started a signaling pathway in epithelial cells in the colon that instructed them to stop dividing the study s leaders and other experts warned however that although the study results are intriguing they do not mean that a ketogenic diet or taking a bhb supplement should be used to prevent or treat colorectal cancer in the study the research team led by christoph thaiss ph d and maayan levy ph d from the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania found that treatment with bhb alone slowed or stopped the growth of colorectal tumors in mice independent of the diet they were fed it also slowed the growth of colorectal cancer cells taken from people and grown in the lab when we treated colorectal cancer cells with bhb they didn t die but they seemed to start sleeping basically said dr levy the study results published on april in nature offer potentially important new insights into one of the most common cancers said phillip daschner m sc of nci s division of cancer biology who was not involved in the study this is a significant contribution to our understanding of the link between diet and colon cancer risk daschner said but additional studies on bhb s effects in people are needed such as clinical trials using bhb supplements before any conclusions can be made about its role in cancer prevention or treatment tricking the body the human body is resilient when food is scarce it shifts from breaking down and using calories from the diet to dipping into its reserves of fat ketosis is the process by which fat is transformed into molecules known as ketone bodies that can serve as emergency fuel for the body many studies have suggested that ketosis triggered by fasting may have health benefits for some people these include reduced blood sugar levels and improved sensitivity to insulin relatedly a type of diet called the ketogenic or keto diet has grown in popularity as a weight loss method this diet uses fat as the primary source of calories up to in extreme cases and drastically limits carbohydrates as long as carbohydrates are low enough the body is basically tricked into the same response as if it was starving explains dr levy this response includes the production of a variety of ketone bodies such as acetoacetate and bhb the keto diet does seem to help some people lose weight in the short term although its long term safety and ability to maintain weight loss are unclear but researchers have also long been intrigued about whether fasting and diets that mimic fasting including the keto diet could potentially help to prevent cancer or even play a part in treating in it before this study previous research suggested that fasting is beneficial in various kinds of cancer explained dr thaiss but such diets are difficult to stick to he added so we re looking for things that would be as beneficial as fasting without fasting itself putting cancer cells to sleep the research team started by feeding mice one of six different diets containing varying levels of fats and carbohydrates two were ketogenic being composed of fat the mice were then exposed to chemicals that caused them to develop colorectal cancer mice fed either of the ketogenic diets had fewer tumors and smaller tumors than mice fed diets with a higher percentage of carbohydrates mice with colorectal cancer fed the ketogenic diets also lived longer similar results were seen when the researchers repeated these experiments using mice engineered to develop colorectal cancer which develop tumors spontaneously when mice were fed a ketogenic diet after tumors had already formed their tumors grew very slowly or stopped growing altogether when the researchers discontinued the diet the tumors started growing again further experiments ruled out that the keto diets effects on tumor growth were due to differences in calories between the diets changes in the immune system or reduced inflammation however the researchers did observe a decrease in cell division proliferation in the epithelial cells lining the colon and in colorectal cancer cells in mice fed the ketogenic diet what caused these effects further work pointed to ketone bodies as the critical component among the ketone bodies they analyzed using mouse intestinal tissue grown in lab dishes bhb stood out it reduced the growth of both normal intestinal tissues without causing damage to healthy epithelial cells and of intestinal tumors harnessing an evolutionary advantage next the team tested whether bhb alone could have effects similar to those of a ketogenic diet they gave bhb to mice with colorectal cancer that were fed a normal diet using bhb levels designed to mimic concentrations that would be induced by ketosis giving bhb alone even in the presence of normal amounts of carbohydrates decreased tumor growth using cultured intestinal tissue the researchers found that bhb binds to a receptor on epithelial cells called hcar this binding in turn boosts the activity of a gene called hopx setting off a cascade that eventually signals cells to stop dividing evolutionarily the ability of bhb to slow or stop cell growth makes perfect sense dr thaiss explained ketone bodies are a source of emergency energy for the brain and based on our study that same molecule has a second property which is to shut down everything else that is energy consuming he said if the body is starving and you want to keep your brain alive it would be a waste of energy to let cells proliferate the body can fix things later once it s been fed and this ability of ketone bodies to stop cell growth in the periphery of the body also seemed to slow colorectal tumor growth he added in a final set of experiments the team studied the effect of bhb on human tissue both colon samples taken from healthy human donors and tumor samples from people with colorectal cancer in lab dishes does too much fructose help colorectal cancers grow in mice fructose made cancer cells in the intestines live longer similar to the results in mice bhb reduced growth of both types of tissue it also boosted the expression of hopx the human version of hopx when the researchers treated cells that didn t have the hopx gene with bhb the compound didn t slow cell growth which the researchers believe indicates the signaling pathway controlled by hopx is necessary for bhb to have an effect towards human studies of bhb bhb slowed growth of human colorectal cells in the lab so now the researchers want to learn whether it works in people specifically they want to know if boosting bhb levels could slow abnormal cell growth and extend the period when precancerous polyps might be detected before they grow into full blown cancer because as long as you can find polyps early you can remove them before they become invasive dr thaiss explained they have launched a small clinical trial to start looking for an answer the study will enroll people with lynch syndrome a genetic condition that predisposes people to develop many types of cancer including colorectal cancer participants will have tissue samples taken during a routine colonoscopy they ll then be given a bhb laced drink to consume daily for weeks after which they ll return for a second round of sample collection the idea is to see first if the drink is safe that it doesn t cause any side effects said dr levy the second is to see if the same mechanism that we identified in mice is also relevant in people we have the first evidence that it is the case in the current study but we want to see when we do this kind of intervention do we see the same changes in gene expression in living people if they do see these effects the next step would be a study to see if bhb could slow polyp growth in people she explained and if bhb is found to suppress polyp growth in people many other intriguing questions arise in addition to prevention said dr thaiss could bhb supplements be used in tandem with colorectal cancer treatments and could bhb s effect be seen in cancers that form outside of the digestive tract there have been reports that ketogenic diets may be beneficial during treatment in some cancer types but detrimental in others he said so we want to understand what kind of tumors could benefit from bhb versus other contexts where it might have no effect at all or even be harmful microbiome s impact on bhb another factor potentially complicating the understanding of how bhb works in the colon is that the current study didn t touch on the microbiome s possible role in influencing the body s response to different nutrients daschner said the microbiome the collection of bacteria fungi and viruses that live in the human gut and that varies widely from person to person has been shown to play a role in weight gain and loss some inflammatory diseases and even whether people respond to some cancer therapies the makeup of a given person s microbiome can affect its interactions with nutrients medications and anything else that passes through the gut in some people depending on their microbiome bhb may not have an effect he explained so for now bhb is a don t try this at home scenario said daschner it s currently sold widely as a dietary supplement but its risks and benefits need much more study this was a mouse study and mouse metabolism is different from human metabolism so whether or not these findings translate to clinical situations is still unknown he cautioned this wasn t tried in patients in this study agreed dr levy we re optimistic based on the data we gathered from mouse models but we should definitely wait

nci staff in mice cancer cells blue that spread to the lymph nodes orange appear to convince immune cells purple to help the cancer spread to other organs lungs and liver credit nathan reticker flynn ph d before a tumor spreads from its original location to other parts of the body it typically invades nearby lymph nodes for more than a century researchers have debated whether this invasion of lymph nodes helps the cancer spread or metastasize to other organs a new study in mice suggests that it is an important step for cancer metastasis and details how that happens lymph nodes are bean shaped organs that filter viruses bacteria and cancer cells out of the body when you re sick and the doctor feels the sides of your neck they re checking to see if your lymph nodes are swollen with immune cells fighting off an infection the study partially funded by nci s cancer systems biology consortium showed that cancer cells in the lymph nodes of mice encourage immune cells to protect tumors rather than attack them as a result the initial tumor essentially gains a pass to spread to the rest of the body the findings were published may in cell cancer cells not only avoid attack in the lymph nodes but they actually turn things completely around and somehow convince the immune system to help the tumor spread explained the study s senior scientist edgar engleman m d of stanford medicine many studies have looked at the interplay of immune cells and cancer cells inside tumors but these findings highlight action happening somewhere else outside of the metastatic and primary tumors said hannah dueck ph d of nci s division of cancer biology it highlights the role of the lymph nodes in the overall immune response to cancer she said with some exceptions the study was mostly carried out in mice implanted with melanoma so additional studies are needed to see if the same phenomenon happens in people and with other kinds of cancer dr dueck noted what are lymph nodes lymph nodes are the heart and soul of the immune system dr engleman said but they haven t gotten as much attention as they deserve he added lymph a watery mixture of immune cells and fluid flows through our bodies via a network of veinlike pipes hundreds of lymph nodes are dotted along this network lymph nodes are like sophisticated training centers inside immune cells learn how to fight infections and cancer once fully trained the immune cells leave the lymph nodes to monitor the body for intruders to metastasize cancer cells break off from the primary tumor and travel through the blood or lymph to other organs if someone is found to have cancer in their lymph nodes it s usually a bad sign that the cancer has or will soon spread to other parts of the body most cancer deaths are caused by metastatic cancer but it s never been clear what cancer cells are actually doing in the lymph nodes one of the theories is that in the lymph node cancer cells gain traits that make them metastatic and then from there they go to the distant organ dr dueck explained there is another theory that some cells from the tumor go to the lymph nodes and some go to the distant organ she said with this view the lymph nodes don t play a critical role in metastasis she added with the necessary models and tools at their disposal dr engleman s team set out to address the long standing debate about these two theories spreading to lymph nodes helps cancer metastasize the researchers first asked whether cancer in the lymph nodes of mice helps tumors metastasize to the lungs one of the most common places cancer spreads to they implanted groups of melanoma cells under the skin of mice and let them form tumors in some mice the cancer spread to the lymph nodes and in other mice it didn t after several weeks the researchers injected melanoma cells that don t spread to lymph nodes into the veins of the mice and then checked their lungs for cancer melanoma cells that pass through lymph more likely to spread cells that take this detour are more resistant to cell death researchers found there were far more tumors in the lungs of mice that had cancer in their lymph nodes than in mice that didn t they found so it appears that spreading to lymph nodes helps cancer metastasize to the lungs dr engleman said cancer cells dodge attack on the way to lymph nodes next the researchers asked what gives some melanoma cells the ability to spread to the lymph nodes they found that cancer cells that had spread to the lymph nodes had higher levels of certain proteins including pd l and mhc i than melanoma cells that didn t spread high levels of pd l and mhc i send signals that tell cancer fighting immune cells not to attack further studies confirmed that higher levels of pd l and mhc i shielded melanoma cells from attack by immune cells more specifically immune cells called nk cells killed fewer melanoma cells that spread to the lymph nodes than melanoma cells that didn t spread it s quite remarkable what cancer cells have to dodge on the way to the lymph nodes there is lots of immune attack dr engleman explained cancer highjacks the immune system the researchers also explored what happens once cancer gets to the lymph nodes similar to what other studies have found it appears that when cancer cells arrive they shift the amounts and types of immune cells in the lymph nodes in mice for example there were fewer cancer killing immune cells in lymph nodes that were invaded by melanoma than in lymph nodes that were cancer free the researchers found there were also more immune cells called t regulatory cells t regs in lymph nodes that were invaded by melanoma cells and in tissue samples from people with head and neck cancer there were more t regs in lymph nodes where cancer had invaded than in lymph nodes that were cancer free the main role of t regs is to protect healthy cells from attack by other immune cells that have gone off the rails by doing so t regs help prevent autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation but t regs can sometimes get mixed up protecting unhealthy cells that should be eliminated like cancer cells that s exactly what the researchers appeared to see in their mouse studies in mice that were bred to lack t regs melanoma tumors were less able to spread to the lungs the scientists then removed t regs from the lymph nodes of mice where melanoma had or hadn t invaded they transferred the t regs into other mice with melanoma that hadn t invaded the lymph nodes only the t regs from lymph nodes with cancer helped melanoma cells spread to the lungs the researchers found like other kinds of t cells t regs have special receptors that let them recognize the cells they protect in mice with melanoma that invaded into lymph nodes the researchers found t regs that recognized the cancer cells in the near future the team plans to examine exactly how cancer cells in the lymph nodes coax t regs to protect them a new view of cancer metastasis in the lymph nodes immune cells learn what to attack such as infected cells and what to protect such as healthy cells but this study suggests that in lymph nodes invaded by cancer immune cells learn to protect the cancer cells rather than attack them dr engleman said this phenomenon is called immune tolerance the research team suspects that those specialized t reg cells once they re educated by the tumor leave the lymph node go all over the body and instruct the immune system not to attack other cancer cells he explained if that s the case it would make distant organs more hospitable to the cancer he said thus we propose a new model of metastasis we call metastatic tolerance tweeted the study s lead scientist nathan reticker flynn ph d of stanford university there s missing pieces about how exactly the t regulatory cells get sent around the body dr dueck noted but the idea is that there might be tolerance from the immune system by the time the cancer cells get to distant organs with this new view of metastasis the two prevailing theories on lymph nodes can be reconciled dr dueck explained by spreading to lymph nodes and turning immune tolerance on it s easier for cancer cells in the primary tumor or in the lymph nodes to metastasize to distant organs dr engleman and his team think it may be possible to develop therapies that switch off this tolerance if used at the right time such therapies could prevent cancer metastasis the findings could also prompt new research on cancer immunotherapies dr dueck noted in some cases resistance to immunotherapy may involve some sort of effect in the lymph nodes so the study findings could also provide clues about ways to address resistance to immunotherapy she said older post new drugs raise old questions about treating cancer

staff about in pregnant women is diagnosed with cancer newer treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted drugs have not been evaluated in this group of patients credit istock in the fall of leticia ramos mateo was weeks pregnant when she received some unwelcome news her cancer had come back three years earlier ms ramos mateo had been treated for hodgkin lymphoma but she d had no signs of the disease since completing treatment now at age and at the end of her first trimester she was facing a recurrence doctors at her local hospital in new jersey had detected multiple tumors including a volleyball sized mass growing in her upper abdomen i was worried that i might not survive recalled ms ramos mateo who had decided not to terminate the pregnancy but she did survive and she recently celebrated the first birthday of her son who was born without any signs of harm from the treatment his mother received while pregnant with him the baby is healthy and talks a lot ms ramos mateo said he s small but we don t worry about his size because i am also tiny ms ramos mateo was treated with the immunotherapy drug nivolumab opdivo a type of immune checkpoint inhibitor by blocking proteins called immune checkpoints these drugs restore the ability of immune cells to attack cancer cells nivolumab is approved to treat hodgkin lymphoma but ms ramos mateo may have been the first pregnant person with a lymphoma to be given immunotherapy intentionally although ms ramos mateo s story has a happy ending her experience underscores how little is known about using newer therapies such as targeted therapies and immunotherapy drugs to treat cancer during pregnancy according to andrew evens d o m b a m sc of the rutgers cancer institute of new jersey dr evens who specializes in treating pregnant women with lymphoma led the multidisciplinary team that took over the care of ms ramos mateo from her local hospital when she was weeks pregnant focusing on a uniquely vulnerable population of patients the team recently published a case study describing ms ramos mateo s treatment in the american journal of hematology after dr evens presented the study at a scientific meeting last year several doctors contacted him seeking advice about how to treat their pregnant patients with cancer about in pregnant women is diagnosed with cancer lymphoma is among the cancers that occur most frequently during pregnancy cancer during pregnancy may be more common than we realize perhaps because it does not get reported and talked about said dr evens we re sharing our findings in part because we want people to practice evidence based medicine even though there s not a great deal of published data pregnant people are excluded from clinical trials of new drugs to ensure that they and their developing fetuses are not exposed to potentially toxic treatments a result is that no one knows whether many newer cancer treatments are safe and effective during pregnancy we need a national effort to evaluate standard treatments for cancer in pregnant patients he said our new case report can help shine a light on the need to help a uniquely vulnerable population of patients crowdsourcing questions about immunotherapy and cancer during pregnancy ms ramos mateo s experience illustrates the need to expand treatment options for pregnant people with cancer beginning in week of her pregnancy she received a chemotherapy regimen that has been used to treat pregnant women with cancer after the first trimester the first weeks of pregnancy her symptoms such as severe abdominal pain caused by a tumor improved temporarily but by the th week of her pregnancy multiple tumors including one near the baby were growing unchecked dr evens estimated that she had weeks to live fertility preservation safe for young women with breast cancer the finding supports offering fertility preservation as part of standard care experts say nivolumab is very effective in many patients with hodgkin lymphoma noted dr evens we thought the drug would work but we wanted to have some confidence that it would be safe for the mother and the baby he said there were no published studies demonstrating the safety of immunotherapy in pregnant women with relapsed hodgkin lymphoma and there were few case reports describing the use of immunotherapy drugs in pregnant women with any type of cancer after reviewing the scientific literature dr evens posted a message on twitter asking if anyone in the medical community had experience using immune checkpoint inhibitors during pregnancy he received a helpful response elad sharon m d m p h of nci s cancer therapy evaluation program replied that he had some unpublished data from a case series he d never met dr evens but they began a conversation that led to a collaboration dr sharon s team had identified reports of nine participants in nci sponsored clinical trials who had unexpectedly become pregnant while receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors seven of these women decided to continue their pregnancies and all gave birth to healthy infants these pregnancies turned out just fine said dr sharon we thought this was scientifically interesting and potentially important for public health at least for women who experience cancer while pregnant the anecdotal information along with some case reports describing similar outcomes gave dr evens and his team confidence that nivolumab might benefit ms ramos mateo despite the potential risks she agreed to try the therapy testing blood levels of an immunotherapy drug in the umbilical cord the drug worked better than i expected said dr evens the patient s tumors melted away she went into a complete remission and gave birth to a healthy baby boy a few weeks after giving birth ms ramos mateo had a stem cell transplant and her cancer has remained in remission in addition to being the first pregnant person with a lymphoma to intentionally receive an immune checkpoint inhibitor ms ramos mateo received her final dose of nivolumab when she was weeks pregnant there were no previous reports of pregnant people receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors beyond weeks of pregnancy ms ramos mateo gave her doctors permission to collect blood samples including from the umbilical cord and the placenta for research purposes a team at nci s center for cancer research documented perhaps for the first time the blood levels of an immunotherapy drug in a placenta and an umbilical cord during pregnancy we wanted to learn as much as we could from the care of this individual patient to inform what we would do for the next patient said dr sharon one question was whether nivolumab had reached the fetus the researchers did not collect any blood from the fetus but they found nivolumab in the umbilical cord blood which meant that the drug had reached the fetus according to dr sharon we did not observe any harmful effects of the drug on the baby dr sharon said the questions now are which factors may be more likely to cause harm to a developing fetus and what should we be watching out for that will be the focus of future research building a registry about pregnant patients with cancer the decision to treat cancer during pregnancy involves weighing the risk of exposing the fetus to medication versus the risk to the mother s untreated illness if you don t expose the fetus to medication said elyce cardonick m d an obstetrician at cooper university health care who specializes in high risk pregnancies there s a growing recognition among doctors dr cardonick continued that if a pregnant woman with cancer cannot delay treatment until delivery it is generally safe to use chemotherapy in the second and third trimester if a woman has a very aggressive tumor in the first trimester however then unfortunately we may have to discuss termination of the pregnancy because we can t use aggressive chemotherapy in the first trimester dr cardonick added chemotherapy is not used during the first trimester because the drug could affect developing organs in the fetus dr cardonick runs a registry of people with cancer who were diagnosed during pregnancy launched in the database now has information on the treatment and outcomes of about women and their children the registry includes a wealth of information about pregnant women treated with older drugs with the newer drugs we are really starting over dr cardonick said we have to collect information about the new drugs one case at a time just as we have done with chemotherapy but she welcomes the challenge she said new drugs may offer hope to pregnant people with certain cancers like melanoma that haven t responded to chemotherapy immunotherapy has helped to transform the care of people with advanced melanoma and although more research is needed there is some evidence that immunotherapy may benefit pregnant patients with the disease before the recent approval of new drugs we had not been able to help pregnant women with melanoma outside of surgery it was really sad said dr cardonick but now with immunotherapy we have something else we can offer them which is amazing a growing need for information on immunotherapy during pregnancy the expanding use of immunotherapy to treat cancer has created a great need for information about using these drugs in pregnancy said fr d ric amant m d ph d of the university of leuven in belgium who studies cancer during pregnancy most of what is known about the use of immunotherapy during pregnancy comes from patients in their first few months of pregnancy because women have tended to stop immunotherapy once they have learned that they were expecting he noted some good news on pregnancy for childhood cancer survivors as adults survivors typically have healthy babies but some risks during pregnancy long term studies of children who are exposed to cancer treatments in utero and their mothers should be priorities for the field dr amant continued dr amant leads the international network on cancer infertility and pregnancy incip a research organization that collects information from around the globe about women who developed cancer during pregnancy and their children in incip reported that exposure to chemotherapy in utero did not raise the risk of developmental or cognitive problems after birth guidance and support for physicians and pregnant women with questions about treating cancer during pregnancy are available for example the advisory board on cancer infertility and pregnancy offers physicians expert advice about the medical care of pregnant women diagnosed with cancer and fertility preservation and the organization hope for two the pregnant with cancer network connects pregnant women who have cancer with other women who have had the same type of cancer during pregnancy exploring questions about including pregnant women in clinical trials experts agree that to improve the care of pregnant women with cancer new studies and particularly those that collect biological samples such as blood are needed such studies could shed new light on all aspects of treating cancer during pregnancy including how pregnancy affects the biology of different types of cancer although well intentioned the practice of keeping pregnant women from participating in clinical trials of cancer treatments has had unintended consequences according to dr sharon by excluding pregnant women from clinical trials we re really not learning anything that could help us treat the next pregnant patient said dr sharon and that s probably a flaw in how we conduct medical research one solution he explained would be to conduct dedicated observational trials in these trials patients with cancer who are pregnant and have no choice but to receive therapy could be monitored to assess the benefits and risks of newer drugs this would allow us to learn more so that we could help future patients who are in the same situation dr sharon said the inclusion of pregnant and lactating participants in clinical trials will be discussed june at a workshop hosted by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine the meeting will highlight gaps in knowledge about the use of drugs during pregnancy and lactation as well as barriers and opportunities for including people who are pregnant or lactating in clinical trials in the meantime ms ramos mateo hopes that her story can help other pregnant women who are diagnosed with cancer she is planning to bring her son to her next appointment with dr evens because of covid restrictions dr evens has never seen the baby said ms ramos mateo but they will soon meet and it will be a blessing studying cancers found by noninvasive prenatal tests noninvasive prenatal tests nipt that pregnant women use to detect common chromosomal abnormalities in a fetus can also suggest that the mother may have cancer though it is uncommon noninvasive prenatal tests have detected abnormal chromosomes resulting from an undiagnosed cancer in the mother rather than chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus christina annunziata m d ph d an investigator in nci s center for cancer research women s malignancies branch is leading a study to learn more about the biology of these cancers the big question we are trying to answer is what s the frequency of cancer when the prenatal screening test finds abnormal chromosomes and the baby s chromosomes are normal said dr annunziata although the number of participants is still small she continued many of the women enrolled in the pilot study

may by nci staff in the checkmate trial people with early stage non small cell lung cancer stage ib to iiia received either nivolumab opdivo and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone before surgery credit national cancer institute when lung cancer is found before it has spread beyond the lungs patients usually have surgery to remove the tumor unfortunately even when the cancer is caught early and surgery removes all of the tumor the cancer often comes back now results from a large clinical trial show that treatment with the immunotherapy drug nivolumab opdivo and chemotherapy before surgery can substantially delay the progression or return of the cancer in the trial called checkmate patients with early stage non small cell lung cancer nsclc were given either nivolumab and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone before surgery known as neoadjuvant therapy patients who received the combination lived longer without experiencing serious events including their cancer returning trial participants haven t been followed long enough to determine whether the combination treatment also improved how long they live overall in march based on the trial s results the food and drug administration fda approved nivolumab as a neoadjuvant treatment in combination with chemotherapy for people with early stage nsclc findings from the checkmate trial were presented in april at the american association for cancer research aacr annual meeting and published simultaneously in the new england journal of medicine nejm progress in lung cancer typically happens by slow progress punctuated by quantum leaps said david paul carbone m d ph d of ohio state university who was not involved in the study at the aacr meeting these results may represent one of those leaps dr carbone continued combining immunotherapy with surgery is a new standard of care and will almost certainly improve overall survival in early stage disease for the first time in decades dr carbone said shifting treatments for early stage lung cancer non small cell lung cancer the most common form of lung cancer has often already spread beyond the lungs when it is diagnosed so research has largely focused on people with more advanced forms of the disease however over the past years the percentage of people diagnosed with early stage lung cancer has slowly increased as more people who are at increased risk for lung cancer are getting screened prescribing chemotherapy before surgery for people with early stage nsclc is not new but its use in everyday care has been limited because it only modestly increases how long patients live over the past several years fda has approved two drugs as post surgical or adjuvant treatment in people with early stage nsclc they include osimertinib tagrisso which is approved for patients whose tumors have mutations in the egfr gene and the immunotherapy drug atezolizumab tecentriq which is approved for use in patients whose tumors have increased levels of the immune checkpoint protein called pd l immunotherapy drugs are standard treatments for advanced lung cancer but these approvals were the first for earlier stage lung cancer following promising findings from smaller clinical trials the phase checkmate trial was launched to provide more definitive answers about the effectiveness of adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early stage nsclc the trial was sponsored by bristol myers squibb which manufactures nivolumab improved event free survival with nivolumab and chemotherapy the trial enrolled patients with early stage nsclc which was defined as stage ib to stage iiia these patients were randomly assigned to receive three rounds of chemotherapy and nivolumab or just chemotherapy with surgery scheduled within weeks after a follow up of at least months the patients who received nivolumab treatment lived on average months longer without experiencing a serious event including their cancer coming back or getting worse or death from any cause a measure known as event free survival treatment group event free survival median patients alive without an event at year patients alive without an event at years nivolumab chemotherapy months chemotherapy placebo months additionally of tissue samples from patients who received nivolumab and chemotherapy showed no signs of cancer known as a complete pathologic response compared with only from patients who received chemotherapy alone also participants who had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy generally had much better event free survival than those who didn t patients who received nivolumab and chemotherapy were also more likely to have minimally invasive surgery instead of standard open surgery the trial was not designed to definitively determine whether tumors in patients who benefited most from the addition of nivolumab had specific tumor characteristics but it had some suggestive results explained the study s lead investigator nicolas girard m d ph d of the curie montsouris chest center during a presentation at the aacr meeting for example patients whose tumors had elevated levels of pd l proteins which nivolumab targets had longer event free survival and were more likely to have a pathologic complete response although immune checkpoint inhibitors can have serious side effects there was no increased toxicity or surgical complications with the addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy in this trial said dr girard only a handful of patients who received nivolumab had immune related side effects e g skin rash and these were mild he said impact on treatment of early stage lung cancer because fda approved nivolumab plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy just recently there was general agreement among experts that it may take time for this treatment to be used broadly for example one of the biggest challenges will be ensuring that patients are actually given the option for neoadjuvant therapy said christine lovly m d ph d of the vanderbilt ingram cancer center who specializes in treating lung cancer most people diagnosed with early stage lung cancer don t see a medical oncologist who would prescribe this treatment until after they ve had surgery to remove their tumor fda approves first cancer drug to target kras approval is for sotorasib lumakras to treat advanced lung cancer if you re going to do neoadjuvant therapy you have to be able to plan the timing of it with medical oncologists and with the surgeon said dr lovly who was not involved in the trial you re going to have to have more coordination of care across multiple medical specialties thankfully this is a solvable problem she continued because successful models of neoadjuvant care already exist for other cancers like breast cancer they routinely use neoadjuvant care so there are breast cancer centers where multidisciplinary teams are sitting under the same roof said dr lovly who also wrote an editorial on the trial results in nejm i think it s completely possible to do this for lung cancer but health care systems are going to have to adapt more research is needed to understand how to best use the available neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment options dr carbone said at the aacr meeting he argued against using neoadjuvant immunotherapy as a one size fits all solution every patient s tumor is different he said and better tumor biomarkers are needed to tailor treatments to patients based on the trial results showing a preliminary correlation between pathologic complete response and longer event free survival he said pathologic complete response may be a possible surrogate that we can use to help optimize our neoadjuvant regimens another question is whether all patients with early stage disease should get neoadjuvant treatment noted dr lovly for example data from the trial suggested that patients with stage iiia cancer did better than patients diagnosed with cancer at an earlier stage in terms of both event free survival and pathologic complete response but further work is still needed to decide how to use these results to inform patient treatment plans dr lovly said in the checkmate trial treatment after surgery was optional who will benefit most from adjuvant therapy in combination with neoadjuvant therapy and which treatments should be used are open questions that will be answered in the years to come dr lovly said there will be years of additional studies to try and figure out how to refine the treatment of early stage nsclc she said we re very grateful to have options for our patients but ultimately it takes time to figure out who benefits the most and how we can best use this new treatment older post working to close the cancer screening gap caused by

cancer screening rates drastically dropped during the covid pandemic so many hospitals and community health centers are now trying to bring screening rates back to pre pandemic levels credit istock as the coronavirus pandemic raged in the number of people getting screened for cancer in the united states dropped dramatically many screening facilities closed temporarily while others faced severe staffing shortages on top of that people were afraid to go to hospitals and other medical facilities for nonemergency procedures for fear of catching covid an estimated million screening tests that normally would have taken place in the united states in didn t happen these missed screenings many experts worry could potentially lead to cancers being diagnosed at a more advanced stage and ultimately to more people dying from cancer a new effort led by the american college of surgeons in collaboration with the american cancer society aims to close the covid induced screening gap by helping cancer facilities implement a broad range of strategies to bring their screening rates back up to their pre pandemic levels this initiative called the return to screening study is one of the largest such efforts in the united states details of the study appeared march in cancer with outcomes anticipated to be published later this year all of the participating cancer facilities figured out what their screening gaps were and where they needed to put their efforts to close them said heidi nelson m d medical director of cancer programs at the american college of surgeons who is leading the study similar efforts by individual institutions have also been launched around the country including some at community health centers that are focused on screening for specific cancers or in specific population groups what remains to be seen is the extent to which such initiatives will address meaningful gaps in screening such as for cancer types in which screening continues to lag and underserved populations that have low screening rates said jennifer croswell m d m p h of the healthcare delivery research program in nci s division of cancer control and population sciences many of these organizations have bounced back to their pre pandemic levels of screening that doesn t necessarily mean everything s great dr croswell said there are pockets where people in underserved areas are doing a lot worse than others a big question that dr croswell is hoping some of these efforts can answer is how do we provide help for those underserved places to catch up with the rest of the country in terms of screening getting people back to screening in the return to screening study accredited cancer facilities from small community based programs to large academic cancer centers implemented strategies from june through november to increase the rate of breast lung colorectal and cervical cancer screening at their facility the participating groups aimed to add a total of additional screening tests per month by the end of the month period dr nelson noted that the study encouraged cancer facilities to use evidence based interventions that are known to be effective in raising screening rates some of these strategies outlined in a toolkit by the american cancer society focused on increasing public awareness of screening including through social media campaigns and patient education others focused on health care providers using various means of reminding doctors to order screening tests for their patients and bolstering their knowledge of screening guidelines a third strategy sought to increase access to screening for example by extending the hours when screening is available or providing financial support to those who do not have health insurance cancer screening drops during covid pandemic covid has created obstacles and opportunities for improving screening we did not prescribe what interventions centers should use dr nelson said however she added we did encourage them to select more than one kind of intervention if you only reached out to your community but didn t increase awareness among health care professionals then you re still going to have a screening gap each cancer facility determined their pre pandemic screening levels then implemented a combination of interventions aimed at getting their monthly screening volumes back up to these levels programs whose monthly screening volumes dipped by less than during the pandemic were tasked with exceeding their pre pandemic screening levels by at least taking a multipronged approach several of the participating cancer facilities offered an early look at the interventions they undertook and how their monthly screening rates have changed angie caton r n assistant nurse manager of oncology services at northeast georgia medical center said that this medical center averaged around screening mammograms a month before the pandemic that number dropped to at one point during the pandemic at the same time we started noticing a very big drop in our tumor pathology reports ms caton said every day doctors were reporting fewer surgeries but you know there s cancer out there that s when we raised the red flag at our organization two internal medicine residents volunteered to track which people were overdue for screening and reminded doctors to order those screening exams at the same time the imaging centers made sure they had the capacity and staff to handle the increased volume of tests in addition the medical center leveraged activities like community luncheons and social media outreach creating facebook posts about mammography and translating those posts into five different languages ms caton said that the medical center used more than different interventions over the month period in any month we had interventions going on at the same time she said the investment paid off in rebounding screening numbers by december the average monthly volume of screening mammograms had reached the medical center s goal was to do mammograms over the month study period they ended up doing mammograms at henry ford health in the metropolitan detroit area donna long r n manager of screening and tumor boards said efforts were focused on african american and hispanic women between the ages of and because that population had lower mammography rates than other groups even before the pandemic started hospital staff held virtual focus groups with people in the community to find out what barriers prevented people from going in for screening the barriers related less to logistical matters such as lacking transportation or childcare than they had anticipated ms long explained instead many people said that they didn t know they needed to be screened or were afraid of what the tests would show hospital staff worked with parish nurses to educate church congregations about screening part of our education included explaining who should have a mammogram what to expect during the mammogram and how to access the services she said and then henry ford community health workers made direct calls to patients to help them schedule an appointment by the end of the month period the system had increased the number of mammograms performed by almost among african american women and among hispanic women compared with according to data provided by ms long we used focused and intentional actions and we had a great outcome she said in a virtual session in september other cancer programs participating in the return to screening study shared the interventions that worked for them jonathan boggs an oncology quality assurance coordinator at appalachian regional healthcare said that one of the challenges with serving a rural area is the lack of health literacy so staff in the health care system made sure all the materials they created to promote breast and cervical cancer screening used simple language they also started a fund to help people cover some of the costs associated with screening in addition they did a big push to get their own staff screened a lot of them have forgotten to take care of themselves mr boggs said they ve been taking care of covid patients more room for improvement dr croswell said that while it s good to see screening rates rebound having a modest delay in screening caused by the pandemic may not be a major concern especially for people who had been getting regular screenings prior to the disruption we have an opportunity with the disruption in care that occurred to think about changing how we bring people in for screening she said do we make a concerted effort to prioritize those falling through the cracks or do we continue to let it be a system where the first to return are those already well hooked into care and thus at lower risk of an adverse outcome from their delay compared to those years out of date or never screened at all texting may help reduce disparities in colorectal cancer screening findings come from a study that is part of a larger effort to address screening disparities this may also be a good opportunity to double down on cancers in which screening rates have historically been lower among eligible people dr croswell said particularly lung and colorectal cancer in some communities or regions she continued that may be where you would want to put your resources some centers participating in the return to screening study are focusing their efforts on these cancers as are others who are tackling the screening deficit problem on their own in southern california for example the moores cancer center at uc san diego health is working with community health centers to identify potential strategies to improve rates of colorectal cancer screening in underserved communities in the region the strategies include mailing at home stool tests to patients working with gastroenterology practices to improve access to colonoscopies for patients who have a positive at home test and bolstering prevention strategies for clinics providers and patients said the study s lead author jesse nodora dr p h and in rhode island the lifespan cancer institute at rhode island hospital is collaborating with blackstone valley community health care on a study of ways to increase the rates of lung cancer screening among underserved populations in the state the project involves creating short testimonial videos featuring people who had precancerous lung nodules detected through screening at blackstone valley the videos are being filmed in patients native languages and shared on social media in addition people due for screening will receive one on one education and support for things like transportation to their screening appointment and working through the insurance process people in the community are being invited to join a board to offer their ideas on how to increase screening among their peers in february we saw a doubling in lung cancer screening said lead investigator

staff a new initial treatment option may be available to patients with acute myeloid leukemia driven by changes in the idh gene who are unable to have standard chemotherapy credit istock some people with an aggressive blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia aml who are unable to receive intensive chemotherapy as initial treatment for this cancer may soon have a new option for around to of people with aml the disease is driven by changes in a gene called idh in a large international study of people with this form of aml who can t have intensive chemotherapy combining a drug called ivosidenib tibsovo with the chemotherapy drug azacitidine was substantially more effective at producing remissions than azacitidine alone ivosidenib blocks the activity of the protein produced by idh in the clinical trial treatment with both drugs also improved how long patients lived overall a median of years compared with about months for those treated with azacitidine and a placebo results from the trial were published april in the new england journal of medicine in general side effects weren t worse in patients who received the treatment combination in fact patients treated with the combination reported better quality of life during the study than those treated with azacitidine alone the trial was funded by servier pharmaceuticals the maker of ivosidenib one factor that complicates interpretation of these results explained christopher hourigan m d d phil chief of the laboratory of myeloid malignancies at the national heart lung and blood institute is that the trial overlapped with the food and drug administration s fda approval of the combination of azacitidine and venetoclax venclexta for people with aml under that approval the azacitidine venetoclax combination can be used in people with aml who can t receive standard chemotherapy however patients can receive it regardless of whether their leukemia has an idh mutation it s always good to have more treatment options for patients said dr hourigan who was not involved in the trial but these new results present a challenge he continued because they don t help me as a leukemia doctor know how these two drug combinations compare for someone with an idh mutation fda is currently reviewing servier s application to approve the ivosidenib azacitidine combination as an initial treatment for people with aml that has idh mutations balancing risk and benefit if possible people newly diagnosed with aml receive an intensive regimen of multiple chemotherapy drugs with the goal of pushing the disease into a complete remission that is eliminating leukemia cells in the bone marrow but these drug combinations called induction therapy are incredibly taxing on the body most people with aml are older explained olatoyosi odenike m d director of the leukemia program at the university of chicago who was not involved with the study for these patients and for people with many other coexisting medical problems the ability to survive induction therapy is low so it becomes an issue of doing more harm than good dr odenike explained even in very healthy people over the age of aml may not respond to induction therapy she added there are some gene mutations some chromosome abnormalities in leukemia cells that we know don t yield to intensive chemotherapy and they are more common in older adults she said in that case maybe you could physically be able to tolerate the treatment but would you really benefit from it in the united states before the combination of azacitidine and venetoclax was approved people who were ineligible for induction chemotherapy that is they were too sick or past the age considered safe to receive it often received azacitidine alone with the goal of reducing the symptoms of leukemia and extending how long they lived in after the current trial had begun fda expanded its approval of ivosidenib for people with a mutation in the idh gene the drug was approved for use alone in people age or older or for those with other health conditions that would prevent them from receiving intensive chemotherapy this new trial was designed to see if for this group of patients combining the two drugs was better than azacitidine by itself a bomb versus a slow burn about half of the patients in the trial were randomly assigned to receive azacitidine plus ivosidenib and the other half azacitidine plus a placebo the trial planned for people to receive at least six monthly rounds of treatment but participants could continue therapy as long as their disease remained under control the main outcome of event free survival included the time from random assignment to failure of the treatment to cause remission measured at months relapse from remission or death from any cause the investigators also tracked how long people lived overall treatment toxicities and quality of life the trial began in early and stopped enrolling patients earlier than planned in mid when the data panel monitoring the study recommended it be discontinued because there were already far fewer deaths in patients in the combination arm than the azacitidine arm at that point participants had been followed for a median of just over a year after months of people in the combination group had a complete remission compared with of those who received azacitidine plus placebo beyond months additional people in the combination group went into remission such delayed responses are not uncommon with targeted drugs for leukemia explained prapti patel m d an adjunct associate professor at the university of texas southwestern medical center and senior medical director at servier who was involved in another trial of ivosidenib plus azacitidine i tell my patients that standard chemotherapy is like a nuclear bomb going off dr patel said it just goes into the bone marrow and cleans out everything good and bad the result is that with standard chemotherapy remissions happen rapidly she explained in contrast targeted drugs for leukemia tend not to kill cancer cells outright she added instead such drugs stop cancer cells from growing and it takes longer for that to happen so while leukemia remissions caused by chemotherapy usually happen within the first month with targeted drugs it can take months months or even longer she explained in total almost half of those who received azacitidine and ivosidenib had a complete remission compared with just of those who received azacitidine plus placebo of those who had a complete remission more than half no longer had any trace of the idh mutation in their bone marrow such mutation clearance is a sign that someone is likely to have a long lasting response explained dr patel over the course of the study people in the combination therapy group died compared with of those who received azacitidine plus placebo people who received the drug combination reported that their health related quality of life was either the same or better than it had been at the start of the study people who received azacitidine plus placebo didn t report improvements almost all trial participants experienced at least one serious side effect of treatment including a drop in red and white blood cells infections were more common in people receiving azacitdine and placebo bleeding and differentiation syndrome a set of potentially dangerous complications caused by the immune system was more common in people receiving azacitidine and ivosidenib many options many questions with these results many oncologists who treat patients with aml will look at this combination as an additional one that we can offer our patients dr odenike said patients whose cancer has an idh mutation can be treated with azacitidine and venetoclax or with azacitidine plus ivosidenib she said currently even though it s approved for use alone oncologists tend not to use ivosidenib by itself because the remission rates are lower than if you give azacitidine and venetoclax she explained but she echoes dr hourigan s concern that the question that s going to come up is which combination is superior she asked i d want to know that as a patient but we don t have enough information at the moment to say she said both combinations showed similar survival benefits in randomized trials relative to azacitidine alone but it s not possible to directly compare across studies for some patients the choice may come down to which potential side effects are most concerning to them she added a direct comparison may never be done said dr hourigan especially as trials have now moved on to other research questions people have already moved on to triplets there are trials testing azacitidine ivosidenib and venetoclax together he said other questions now being asked include whether adding ivosidenib to induction chemotherapy could improve the remission rate for healthier patients explained dr odenike she and her colleagues recently completed a small trial showing this approach is safe which is the first step to a larger study there is a precedent for this approach in aml such as for people with a flt mutation in their leukemia she said explaining that when we add a flt inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy their survival is improved such trials also highlight an emerging shift in aml treatment dr patel explained while for some people aml is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment even within hours of diagnosis others can wait about a week to have dna sequencing done on their leukemia cells this genetic information may let them use one of the targeted drugs already approved or potentially join a clinical trial of a targeted treatment researchers hope to shrink this sequencing window even further said dr hourigan and to launch trials that compare the different targeted therapy options based on the genetic profile of patients tumors with the current standard of care such comparisons are needed to answer the which is best questions that will continue to emerge he explained the newer targeted therapies may work better for some people but they are also expensive which can cause substantial financial toxicity he added so we want to make sure we re testing them rigorously so we can use them in the most efficacious way older post colonoscopy after positive fit test cuts risk of colorectal

nci staff new research underlines the importance of following up with a colonoscopy exam after a positive abnormal result on an at home stool test to screen for colorectal cancer the test known as the fecal immunochemical test fit checks for traces of blood in patient collected stool samples which can be an early sign of cancer screening for colorectal cancer the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the united states and other high income countries has been shown to reduce deaths from this disease in the new study researchers found that people who had a positive fit result signs of blood in the stool but did not have a follow up colonoscopy were twice as likely to die as those who did have a follow up colonoscopy this study emphasizes that cancer screening is really a process not a single step and shows the importance of completing all steps of the process said gastroenterologist douglas corley m d ph d of kaiser permanente northern california who was not involved in the study until now there hasn t been much information on how a lack of follow up testing after a positive fit result may affect people s risk of dying from colorectal cancer dr corley noted findings from the study which was conducted in italy were published march in gut the study points to the importance of more closely monitoring people who do not follow recommendations after a positive fit result said erica breslau ph d m p h of nci s healthcare delivery research program who also was not involved in the study the findings also highlight the need to identify opportunities to improve what is currently being done to ensure that people get the follow up tests they need dr breslau said fit is one of the most widely used colorectal cancer screening tests worldwide experts generally recommend that people repeat this test every to years people with a positive fit test result are advised to have a colonoscopy to investigate the cause of the bleeding because a fit test alone cannot diagnose cancer a follow up or diagnostic colonoscopy can find not only colorectal cancer but also precancerous growths or polyps that doctors can remove during the procedure reducing the risk of future cancers if cancer is detected treatment is usually the next step many successful colorectal cancer screening programs including those in the united states use some combination of stool based tests such as fit and screening colonoscopy dr corley said so the new study results are very relevant to settings in the united states delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer leads to higher risk of death for the study manuel zorzi m d m sc of the veneto tumour registry in padua italy and his colleagues examined the medical records of participants in a regional colorectal screening program who took a fit test between january and september the program offers free fit testing once every years to people years old stool samples collected at home are sent in for analysis people with a positive fit result are contacted by phone by trained individuals and a follow up colonoscopy exam is offered free of charge the study included people who had a positive fit test of whom people had a follow up colonoscopy as part of the program colonoscopy group and did not no colonoscopy group nearly all of the people who had a follow up colonoscopy did so within a year of the positive fit result the researchers compared the numbers of new colorectal cancer cases diagnosed deaths from colorectal cancer and deaths from any cause in the two groups over time for up to years after an initial positive fit result during the study period fewer than of people in each group died of colorectal cancer however those who did not get a follow up colonoscopy were about twice as likely to die of colorectal cancer over a year period as those who did have a follow up colonoscopy in the colonoscopy group the number of new colorectal cancers diagnosed went up sharply in the first months or so after a positive fit result and leveled off after that texting may help reduce disparities in colorectal cancer screening findings come from a study that is part of a larger effort to address screening disparities the initial sharp rise was expected the researchers noted due to colorectal cancer being found during follow up colonoscopy the low incidence of colorectal cancer after that was likely due to the early detection of cancers and the removal of precancerous lesions during colonoscopy dr breslau explained this demonstrates the longer term protective value of completing the screening process which is another new piece of information provided by the study dr corley said by contrast in the no colonoscopy group new cases went up more gradually but continued rising over years people in this group were more likely to have their cancer detected only after symptoms appeared when the cancer was more advanced this delayed diagnosis likely explains the higher death rate from colorectal cancer in this group dr breslau said room for improvement many colorectal cancer screening programs including some in the united states struggle to ensure timely colonoscopy completion among those with a positive fit with rates as low as dr zorzi and his colleagues wrote but the program in northeast italy which started in has maintained colonoscopy rates of at just months after a positive test result they noted this follow up rate is comparable to some of the best follow up rates in the united states and elsewhere dr corley said yet there s clearly room for improvement this study doesn t help us understand why people aren t following up dr corley said understanding why some people are willing to be screened but do not follow up can lead to improvements in the effectiveness of the screening process multiple factors can contribute to people not getting follow up colonoscopy exams both he and dr breslau said in the united states cancer screening is a complex process that involves multiple steps and can be affected by many factors dr breslau said such factors include the patient s personal circumstances for example access to transportation whether they have health insurance whether they can get timely access to colonoscopy and whether they have had an adequate conversation with their doctor about screening in italy unlike in the united states all citizens are entitled to care that is mostly free through italy s national health service this study shows that even with a national health service that provides universal coverage there are other barriers to obtaining care dr breslau said for example people s fears about the preparation for colonoscopy continue to be a major barrier dr zorzi s team found that people in the no colonoscopy group were at higher risk of dying from all causes not just from colorectal cancer this points to one possible reason why people in this group on average were less likely to get follow up colonoscopy exams dr corley said some people may have had other illnesses that precluded them from having a colonoscopy or made them feel that they were more likely to die from causes other than colorectal cancer he explained the ongoing nci funded prospr program aims to better understand how to improve the cancer screening process and reduce disparities in colorectal and other cancer screening in community health care settings in the united states dr corley who is the lead investigator for the colon cancer component of prospr stressed the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening one study we published showed that by increasing screening rates from to we could cut the incidence of colorectal cancer deaths in half he said this raises the importance of being able to get the individual steps correct and completed as best you can because every step where you lose some people in follow up can have a big impact older post study adds to debate about screening for melanoma newer post ivosidenib with chemotherapy new option for

dermatologists often use a dermatoscope to help determine whether a mole might be a melanoma and should be removed credit istock should people undergo regular checks for skin cancer particularly the deadliest form melanoma that depends on who you ask in its most recent recommendations an influential federal health advisory panel said there isn t enough evidence to recommend for or against routine skin cancer screening but professional dermatology organizations and skin cancer advocacy groups aren t necessarily on the same page with at least one recommending that adults have annual skin checks with that backdrop come new results from one of the largest skin cancer screening initiatives of its kind conducted in the united states the nci supported observational study involved nearly people who went to see their primary care physician for a routine visit the findings were not necessarily surprising they showed that people who were screened for skin cancer during the year study period were more likely to be diagnosed with very early stage melanoma than those who were not screened according to results reported april in jama dermatology in other words the suspect moles found and subsequently removed by doctors during screening were present only on the top layer of the skin known as the epidermis or mm or less below the epidermis these are called in situ or stage and stage melanomas respectively although the study leaders expected that more early stage melanomas would be found they didn t necessarily anticipate the extent to which screening would increase the likelihood of being diagnosed with these thin melanomas in the case of in situ cancers for example the difference was more than two fold the findings reinforce an underlying expectation that comes with screening for any cancer explained the study s lead investigator laura ferris m d ph d professor of dermatology at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine when it comes to cancer screening dr ferris said if you go looking for something you tend to find more of it and you tend to find more early stage disease the findings also contribute to an ongoing debate about screening for skin cancer does it reduce the number of deaths from melanoma which is the goal of screening or is it simply leading to lots of people being diagnosed with a cancer that would never have caused them any harm a phenomenon called overdiagnosis identifying so many early stage melanomas does raise a concern about overdiagnosis dr ferris said but that doesn t mean that some of the melanomas being found aren t potentially deadly it also doesn t mean that the increase in melanoma incidence over the past several decades should be solely chalked up to overdiagnosis and ignored or dismissed as irrelevant that would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater she said uncertainty around screening for melanoma once a rare form of cancer melanoma s incidence in the united states has steadily and consistently climbed over the past five decades it s now the fifth most common cancer behind breast lung prostate and colon as is the case with some of those other common cancers melanoma s increased incidence has been linked to the fact that doctors are looking for it more than they used to routine skin checks specifically a kind known as total body skin examinations have become commonplace among dermatologists in particular even if a person is coming in for another reason when there is a sustained increase in the incidence of a type of cancer that can be found through early detection but the number of people dying from it stays the same it automatically raises concerns about overdiagnosis in other words if truly life threatening cancers were being found early enough to be treated successfully the number of deaths from that cancer should drop what cancer screening statistics really tell us learn to interpret the statistical results of cancer screening studies thyroid cancer for example was once rare but its incidence in the united states skyrocketed over several decades before stabilizing in the mid s the increase was driven largely by the incidental discovery of small thyroid tumors such as during imaging scans of the neck and head for other health problems deaths from thyroid cancer however have remained unchanged melanoma has followed a similar track leading some researchers to argue that screening is not saving lives just leading to more melanoma diagnoses the federal panel the us preventive services task force uspstf issued an inconclusive recommendation on skin cancer screening in the evidence the panel concluded wasn t sufficient to show that screening reduces deaths from melanoma the american academy of dermatology doesn t specifically recommend regular screening but it does promote skin self checks and has long operated a program to help others organize free skin cancer screenings there are no easy answers to the screening question said isaac brownell m d ph d of the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases a skin cancer expert and practicing dermatologist although screening will pick up more early stage cancers the true lethal threat posed by in situ and stage tumors isn t known dr brownell continued some smaller studies however have suggested that they might present a substantial risk of death there are definitely people with early stage disease who will later progress and die if their tumor is not removed dr brownell said uspstf is in the process of updating its recommendations on skin cancer screening it s unclear though whether there s any new evidence that could lead the panel to recommend routine screening typically such evidence would come from a randomized clinical trial the gold standard of medical studies in such studies participants are randomly assigned to specific groups in this case routine screening or usual care and their outcomes are compared for several reasons including a likely very large price tag and complicated logistics there s no expectation that a randomized trial of skin cancer screening will be conducted any time soon wrote robert swerlick m d director of the department of dermatology at the emory university school of medicine in an editorial in jama dermatology that accompanied the new study results while the need for such a trial has been highlighted repeatedly very little has been published regarding how such a study could be undertaken and sufficiently powered to detect an effect of screening examinations on melanoma deaths dr swerlick wrote in the absence of evidence from randomized clinical trials and any consensus from medical groups dr ferris said she and her colleagues had been intrigued by early findings from a large study of skin cancer screening conducted in northern germany initial data from the german study suggested that screening was leading to fewer deaths from melanoma so dr ferris and her colleagues decided to launch a similar study that they hoped could inform screening practices in the united states finding many early stage melanomas the study ran from to in the university of pittsburgh medical center upmc system a hospital and physician organization with a massive footprint in western pennsylvania it enrolled people aged and older who were seeing their primary care physician for a routine office visit participating physicians were not required to ask every patient if they wanted to be screened they also were invited but not required to undergo training on how to perform total body skin exams of the nearly patients who were included in the study about had at least one documented screening during the study period the study s primary measure of interest was the stage of the melanomas diagnosed in the screened and unscreened groups during the year study period more early stage melanomas were diagnosed in both groups than thicker later stage melanomas people in the screening group however were more likely to be diagnosed with an in situ melanoma and more likely to be diagnosed with a stage melanoma in both the screened and unscreened groups most melanoma diagnoses occurred more than months after the initial patient visit these were considered to be interval melanomas which in practical terms means they were most likely diagnosed because of another skin screening or because a patient proactively went to their doctor to get a mole checked because of how the study was designed and conducted it has several limitations dr ferris and her colleagues explained for example people in the study who underwent screening may be more healthful in general the quality of the screenings performed may have been variable and all the relevant information about screening in both groups is likely incomplete all these factors could have affected the study s results they noted is all cancer overdiagnosis created equal the findings from the upmc study provide very strong evidence of overdiagnosis wrote dr swerlick who initially raised concerns about screening induced melanoma overdiagnosis in the mid s the purpose of applying increasing amounts of screening intensity is to avoid melanoma death screening skeptics cannot prove a negative but it should fall on screening advocates to demonstrate that such activities add value to patients lives concerns about the overdiagnosis of cancer that can result from screening are well founded wrote sancy leachman m d ph d director of the melanoma research program at the knight cancer institute in portland oregon and several colleagues in another accompanying editorial in jama dermatology drug may prevent the return of early stage melanoma pembrolizumab after surgery reduced the risk of stage ii melanoma recurrence they argued however that melanoma is different in many respects from other cancers where overdiagnosis has been a concern melanoma is more lethal at a smaller volume compared with other cancers dr leachman and her colleagues explained cancer fueling mutations can quickly build up in melanoma they continued which means that thin melanomas are vulnerable to rapid transformation to thicker more deadly melanomas and although there are now a host of proven treatments for later stage melanomas they are not uniformly effective can have significant side effects and are expensive all those factors make early diagnosis particularly important and counterbalance the risk of overdiagnosis they wrote dr ferris agreed in part removing a thin melanoma found because of screening is far less onerous and potentially dangerous than say the invasive procedures required to follow up on a lesion identified in the lungs during screening for lung cancer that s a much bigger deal than taking a mole off she said but she cautioned that there are potential downsides of melanoma overdiagnosis both for individual people and society more broadly for individuals they now have a cancer diagnosis which can lead to everything from long term anxiety to increased health insurance costs and greater difficulty getting life insurance there s also a shortage of dermatologists in the united states particularly in certain areas of the country the time dermatologists spend on skin checks and the routine follow up tests that can ensue is likely contributing to the long delays to see a dermatologist in some areas she said that can have a trickle down effect we might be limiting our ability to get others with a higher risk of melanoma in for an appointment she said potentially delaying the diagnosis of truly life threatening cancers focusing melanoma screening on those at higher risk in the german study on which the upmc study was partially modeled the early suggestion that screening reduced the number of deaths from melanoma went away after participants were followed for a longer time and with the unlikely prospect of a randomized clinical trial of skin cancer screening dr ferris said researchers will have to be open minded about different ways to evaluate and implement screening one potential way to mitigate melanoma overdiagnosis she continued is to focus screening on those at increased risk of the disease there are no widely recognized criteria for classifying whether a person is at increased melanoma risk but physicians can consider certain factors when deciding whether to conduct full body skin exams said dr brownell who also codirects the cutaneous oncology program at walter reed national military medical center s murtha cancer center for example men over age are more likely to have potentially dangerous melanomas he explained as are people with fair skin who have had blistering sun burns and who have a family or personal history of skin cancer incorporating these sorts of risk factors into physician decision making would simultaneously increase the numbers of melanomas detected per individuals screened and reduce the total number of overdiagnoses dr leachman and her colleagues wrote can new technology help in addition to personal factors that can identify those at increased melanoma risk noninvasive tools are becoming available that can help physicians make more informed choices about whether to remove suspicious moles and potentially reduce overdiagnosis for example dermatologists routinely use dermoscopy which involves a souped up magnifying glass that can zoom in on a mole to look for features that are indicative of those seen in melanoma another imaging based tool starting to be studied called in vivo confocal microscopy provides a cellular view of the skin dr brownell explained it allows physicians to see individual melanocytes the pigment producing cells in which melanoma forms if the clinician sees funny looking melanocytes he said they can then biopsy that lesion this technology is still being studied he noted and is mostly only available at large medical centers one noninvasive method that is increasingly being used in everyday practice relies on a special kind of tape that is placed on a mole and then removed capturing genetic material from melanocytes that material dr ferris explained is then analyzed for the presence of melanoma related genetic changes a newer technology also available mostly at large cancer centers is total body photography typically used on people at high risk of skin cancer or who previously had skin cancer the technology can capture high resolution images of every mole on a person s body in a single short scan techniques using artificial intelligence are also being studied as a way to noninvasively identify cancerous moles but more research is needed to determine if these technologies can help better identify truly dangerous melanomas and limit overdiagnosis dr brownell said until then a screening juggling act is likely to continue as a society we need to ask if the costs and potential harms of overdiagnosis are justified by the number of lives that could be lost to melanoma without screening

by nci staff cutaneous melanomas form on skin covering the body s central regions such as the face chest and back acral melanomas form on the palms of the hands soles of the feet and under the nails credit national cancer institute to become cancerous a cell must accumulate genetic changes that allow it to grow uncontrollably but not all cells with these changes will actually give rise to tumors many things including the immune system can stop a single cancer cell from growing into a full fledged tumor new research suggests that whether a cell with cancer related genetic changes will go on to develop into a tumor also depends on that cell s location in the body virtually all cells in the body have the same genes but how those genes behave can vary depending on several factors including where that cell lives in the body influenced by what are sometimes called positional gene expression programs the varied activity of genes ensure that your nose grows on your face and your toes on your feet each of these programs requires a slew of proteins and other molecules that are unique to their location in studies in zebrafish and human cells researchers have now found that certain oncogenes genes that when altered in certain ways can cause cancer caused a rare type of melanoma to develop in certain parts of the body due to the positional programs they could harness at those locations the results were published march in nature the new studies looked at acral melanoma which grows on the palms of the hands the soles of the feet and under the nails according to richard white m d ph d of memorial sloan kettering cancer center who led the study the findings have implications for the treatment of this rare cancer but they may also hold clues to the way other cancer types develop and can be treated dr white said the idea that there may be specific treatments that work in one part of the body but not others is very compelling he said same cells different cancers melanoma starts in melanocytes cells that produce and contain a pigment called melanin this pigment helps protect the skin from damage from the sun s ultraviolet rays the more melanin a person has the darker their skin is in addition to the skin melanocytes are found in the eyes and even the gut as a result melanoma can arise in many different parts of the body the most common type of melanoma called cutaneous melanoma starts in melanocytes in the skin covering central regions of the body such as the face chest or back over the last decade the treatment of advanced cutaneous melanoma has been revolutionized by the discovery that many such cancers are driven by a set of genes in a cellular communication network called the mapk signaling pathway drugs that target this pathway are now part of standard treatment for people with advanced cutaneous melanoma but noncutaneous melanomas such as those that form in the body s extremities the acral regions usually aren t driven by alterations in the mapk pathway the best current melanoma therapies which were designed to treat cutaneous melanoma don t work as well in acral melanoma explained christine nadeau ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who was not involved with the new study although acral melanoma is rare overall it s more common in black hispanic and asian people than in white people it s perhaps best known for causing the untimely death of the singer bob marley at the age of this higher incidence in minority populations and fewer treatment options likely contribute to poorer survival after a melanoma diagnosis in these groups said dr nadeau and acral melanoma has been understudied added dr white in their study his team used different techniques to look for genetic differences between acral and cutaneous tumor samples from people with one of these types of melanoma the analysis allowed them to identify the presence of specific genetic changes such as mutations in specific cancer related genes and analyze the behavior of specific genes that is which genes were active and influencing cellular behavior as expected mutations in braf a gene in the mapk pathway were the most common mutations in the cutaneous melanoma samples in contrast changes in several other genes including a known cancer related gene called crkl were more common genetic changes in the acral melanoma samples human limbs to fish fins to test the cancer causing potential of these gene changes dr white and his team turned to a zebrafish model they developed from a biological standpoint fish may not seem to have many similarities to humans but they actually have many for example similar genetic positional programs result in fish fins and human limbs despite the evolutionary distance between them dr white explained plus there are many advantages to studying cancer genetics in fish he added one is how fast and easy it is to test which combinations of gene changes might be driving cancer he explained a single fish can lay several hundred eggs per week in contrast a mouse usually has less than pups per litter and gestation takes up to weeks from conception to birth the sheer number of things we can test in fish is just mind blowing in this study we tested almost fish with different genetic combinations that might drive acral melanoma he said when the researchers engineered melanocytes in the fish to have certain braf mutations tumors formed by these cells were much more likely to be found in cutaneous sites on the body s core in contrast cells engineered to have several gene changes common in human acral melanomas including in crkl were much more likely to form tumors in fish fins the analog to acral regions in people additional work found that only crkl changes appeared to be necessary for acral tumors to grow other oncogenes made those tumors grow faster but they weren t needed for a cell in the fin to turn cancerous further experiments in the fish showed that the activity of other non cancer causing genes in melanocytes also differed substantially depending on where in the body the cells resided such as the core versus the fins many of the most active molecular pathways in fin melanocytes were involved in limb development similar results were seen in acral melanoma samples taken from people with many of the most active gene expression pathways related to limb development hijacking a positional pathway for the team the next obvious question was are the cancer causing gene changes seen in acral melanoma like crkl changes somehow exploiting positional programs found only in the fins and limbs and how one such program controlled by a group of genes known as hox was highly active in almost all the samples taken from patients acral melanomas but less active in samples taken from cutaneous melanomas in the fish an excess of the protein produced by crkl ramped up this pathway and caused runaway cell growth but blocking the hox pathway slowed tumor growth in the fins regardless of crkl activity since crkl appears to need this positional pathway to drive tumor growth a kind of natural selection is likely at play in melanoma dr white explained crkl alterations aren t any more likely to occur in the skin on the hands and feet than in skin on other parts of the body but only in the hands and feet can they express their oncogenic potential so to speak and cause runaway cell growth these results go beyond what was already known about how cancer cells are influenced by the normal cells around them also called the tumor microenvironment said dr nadeau it s about more than just where the cells are it s about them participating in these developmental programs that are necessary for things like limb development she explained the findings may not only help researchers better understand the underlying biology of these cancers dr white explained but may also be relevant to developing treatments we think these positional pathways are actually therapeutic vulnerabilities he said that is they raise the possibility that a tumor can be treated by targeting the cross talk between an oncogene and the positional programs in a cell that tell it where it is in the body if you can find a drug that cuts off that communication is that enough to prevent the cell from forming a tumor the concept of cancer cells dependence on a positional program leads to many other interesting questions said dr white such as whether this phenomenon is found in other types of cancer besides melanoma he thinks it may be noting that researchers have already found other examples of tumors that behave differently based on their location such as tumors on the left or right side of the colon or the head or the tail of the pancreas this concept also raises the intriguing idea of treating metastatic cancer differently based on which organ cancer cells have spread to he added maybe we should treat liver metastases different from brain metastases or lung metastases or kidney metastases he said another interesting question raised by the current study is whether the locations in the body to which different tumor types preferentially spread or metastasize are related to the positional programs expressed at those locations added dr nadeau such questions will need to be answered with future research for now said dr nadeau a key result from the current study is the identification of a group of genes led by crkl that help drive acral melanoma and are distinct from those involved in cutaneous melanoma this is important because identifying early genetic features of cells that go on to become acral melanomas can help provide biomarkers for earlier detection and help with the design of new treatments she said right now patients with advanced acral melanoma have limited treatment options it s quite likely that something in the crkl pathway might be a target for treatments to stop tumor growth older post

april by nci staff enlarge a cell with a mutation that occurs during embryo development gray cell grows to form some adult organs producing a mosaic pattern in the person s body credit national cancer institute scientists may have pegged a somewhat surprising cause of cancer for some people according to a new study the culprit is mutations in genes known to be related to cancer cancer susceptibility genes but the unexpected part of their finding was when the mutations occurred in the womb during the earliest days of embryo growth because each embryo cell grows to form a portion of the body s organs and tissues mutations that occur in the womb wind up in a mosaic or patchwork pattern in the person s body as such mutations that pop up during embryo development are aptly called mosaic mutations mutations in cancer susceptibility genes which are known to increase cancer risk are typically thought to be inherited meaning passed from parent to child but the new study highlights that these mutations can also occur after conception as a result of spontaneous errors that happen as cells divide mosaic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes have been reported in rare cases in the past explained senior scientist diana mandelker m d ph d of memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc in new york but we had no idea what the extent of this phenomenon was in cancer patients we re seeing every day dr mandelker said what we found here is that mosaicism affecting cancer susceptibility genes is much more widespread than we previously anticipated said senior scientist jorge reis filho m d ph d also of mskcc looking through the genetic test results of more than people with cancer treated at mskcc the team found patients with mosaic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes the study was published april in cancer discovery finding out whether someone has a mosaic mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene is important for their cancer care noted the study s lead scientist fresia pareja m d ph d of mskcc it can help determine the most appropriate cancer treatment and might also indicate the need to monitor for the growth of additional cancers the research team will continue to check for mosaic mutations in every patient who is treated at mskcc dr mandelker noted and they hope other cancer centers will follow suit overlooked mutations cancer starts with a cell that has a harmful mutation in a gene that controls how cells grow and divide when that mutation arises however can vary for most people with cancer the mutation occurred later in life sometimes years or decades after birth those mutations known as somatic mutations are found in the tumor but not in other cells in the body for a smaller group of people with cancer the mutated gene was inherited from a parent at conception inherited or germline mutations are present in every cell in the body as well as in the tumor previous studies have hinted that cancer related mutations can also occur after conception early in embryo development because each embryo cell goes on to form a specific set of organs and tissues muscles and bones for example these mosaic mutations are present in some cells in the body as well as in the tumor before this study i don t think there was much consideration of this early embryonic mosaicism among cancer researchers and doctors said ian fingerman ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who wasn t involved in the work the general school of thought was you either have germline mutations or somatic mutations dr fingerman said but this new study partially funded by nih could change that view if the findings are confirmed in other studies he said the contribution of mosaic mutations to cancer hadn t been given much thought because they re typically overlooked dr mandelker noted due to technical limitations of conventional genetic tests but with the approach we employed we were able to detect these mosaic mutations that were missed before dr pareja said using msk impact to find mosaic mutations for the study the scientists tapped into data from msk impact a genetic test that scans more than cancer related genes including cancer susceptibility genes for harmful mutations every patient at mskcc gets the test to identify potential treatments that might help them or clinical trials they might be able to join the breakthrough here with msk impact is we are doing paired samples so we have the blood and the tumor tested alongside each other dr mandelker noted that allows them to find mosaic mutations present in both blood and tumor cells she explained the research team scoured the test results of more than patients both children and adults for mosaic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes they identified patients with mutations that fit their criteria for mosaicism those that were present in a fraction of blood cells and in a higher fraction in tumor cells follow up analyses suggested that the mutations likely had a major role in the growth of the patient s tumors the tumors of several patients with mosaic mutations had biological features that are characteristic of the gene that was mutated for example the tumors of people with mosaic mutations in the msh or msh genes had a feature known as microsatellite instability based on their finding that of total patients had mosaic mutations the researchers estimated the frequency of mosaic mutations to be around in but the true number is likely to be higher than that dr reis filho noted because of our study design we were detecting mosaic variants that arose very early in embryo development when embryos are made of just a few cells dr pareja explained but it s possible that mosaic mutations could also occur later in embryo development and there may be other cancer related genes that are affected by mosaic mutations in addition to the cancer susceptibility genes the researchers focused on so we might be seeing the tip of the iceberg she said similarities with inherited germline mutations families with germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes tend to share certain patterns of cancer for example family members may develop cancer at an unusually young age for that type of cancer or develop more than one type of cancer people with mosaic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes had patterns of cancer that were similar to people with germline mutations the researchers found many were diagnosed with cancer at a younger age and some had more than one kind of cancer the types of cancer they developed were also similar for example people with mosaic mutations in the brca gene had breast or ovarian cancer the two most common cancers found in people with germline brca mutations and people with mosaic mutations in the apc gene had colorectal cancer the most common cancer in people with germline apc mutations these findings suggest that even if someone doesn t have a germline mutation or have a family history of cancer having a mutation occur very early in embryonic development can still predispose you to those same types of cancers as someone who does dr fingerman noted the mskcc team s approach for identifying mosaic cancer predisposing alleles could provide substantial benefit to screening practices and suggests that many individuals who have cancer predisposing mosaicism may often be overlooked wrote l alexander liggett ph d and vijay sankaran m d ph d in an accompanying commentary important information for cancer treatment and screening if you have cancer finding out that you have a mosaic mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene is important for three reasons the researchers explained first like germline and somatic mutations mosaic mutations can help guide therapy choices dr pareja said for many of the genes in which they found mosaic mutations there are targeted therapies available to treat tumors with those mutations she explained for example people with mosaic mutations in the msh or msh genes can be treated with the drug pembrolizumab keytruda second having a mosaic mutation in certain genes might put you at risk for other cancers signaling the need to monitor you for the growth of additional cancers what s known as surveillance study participants who were found to have a tp mosaic mutation were put on mskcc s cancer screening protocol for people with a germline tp mutation dr mandelker noted germline mutations in tp cause li fraumeni syndrome a disorder that predisposes people to multiple cancers including bone brain and breast cancer and third mosaic mutations can be passed down to your children if the mutation is present in your egg or sperm cells which can happen depending on when in development the mutation arose and in which cell so it s very important for reproductive counseling as well and for genetic testing of existing children dr mandelker said overall the study findings have brought about a fundamental shift in the way we approach mosaic mutations rather than being incidental findings of academic curiosity they have become important for treatment decision making dr reis filho said older post screening for many cancers with one test uncertainty

castle ph d m p h enlarge mced tests look for biological signals or biomarkers that are released by cancer cells or induced by their presence credit adapted from british journal of cancer https doi org s cc by one of the exciting areas of cancer prevention research is the development of noninvasive tests that may have the potential to easily and accurately determine whether and where in the body a person has early stage cancer and not just for a single cancer but for many cancers over the last several years remarkable progress has been made on this front there are many multi cancer early detection mced tests in development intended to simultaneously screen for multiple types of cancer in otherwise healthy people someday if mced tests prove to be clinically beneficial they may be ordered alongside tests for cholesterol or liver function on its face a test that requires a simple blood draw to tell a symptom free person whether they may have a cancer and where it is in their body seems like an amazing advance this is particularly true for cancers like pancreatic ovarian and brain cancers for which no screening tests exist and that typically are not diagnosed until they are advanced very difficult to treat and highly lethal however as with much of medicine and public health it s not that simple despite their tremendous promise much about mced tests is still unknown and many unanswered questions remain such as who should undergo an mced test and which one would be best for you what happens if subsequent testing doesn t find cancer in a person who tested positive on an mced what is their future risk of cancer will people who receive an mced test then forgo proven cancer screening tests in the future is there the potential for mced tests to exacerbate racial ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in cancer outcomes do they work equally well for everyone and then there is the most important question do these tests actually reduce deaths from cancer which is the ultimate goal of cancer screening finding cancer is not enough if a person s chance of dying from that cancer does not change simply put there is still a substantial level of uncertainty and many unknowns surrounding these tests and it s clear that more robust research on mced tests is needed to understand how best to maximize their benefits and minimize their potential harms as the leader of the national cancer program nci is one of the few institutions that can carry out the large scale studies needed to determine mced tests potential role in improving public health how do mced tests work do they work well mced tests are a type of test known as a liquid biopsy liquid biopsies currently cleared by the food and drug administration fda are used in people who have already been diagnosed with cancer in people with cancer fda cleared liquid biopsies identify specific biological signals in dna rna or proteins released by cancer cells into the blood that information can then guide what specific targeted cancer therapies or immunotherapies patients should receive mced tests also attempt to look in blood for biological signals or biomarkers that are released by cancer cells or induced by their presence however mced tests differ from currently fda cleared liquid biopsies in two ways philip castle ph d m p h director nci division of cancer prevention credit national cancer institute first mced tests are intended for use as cancer screening test in symptom free individuals as opposed to a test in people known to have cancer and second mced tests simultaneously assess multiple signals to determine whether there is a strong likelihood that a person has cancer and in most cases identify where in the body that tumor is located companies with mced tests currently under study claim they can detect anywhere from two or three cancer types up to as many as with one or two exceptions mced studies performed to date used previously collected blood samples from groups of people known to have cancer or not have cancer and thus far these limited data show that they can indeed detect multiple types of cancer however their ability to find cancer when it is present known as their sensitivity varies by test and for each cancer type those same studies have consistently found that mced tests are better at detecting advanced or later stage cancers than earlier stage cancers the latter of which are more easily treated and sometimes cured they also found that the tests had high specificity that is they are highly unlikely to produce a positive result for people without cancer more questions than answers when it comes to screening healthy people to see if they have a disease it s extremely important to show that potential benefits of that screening outweigh any potential harms as i ve already said the most important benefit of a cancer screening test is that it reduces the number of deaths from that cancer when used broadly in the general population achieving that aim raises a critical point the screening test itself is just the beginning particularly if the test result suggests that cancer is present many steps must then occur to confirm that result and if necessary treat the cancer it s those postscreening steps where many of the potential harms of screening can arise of those potential harms two strike me as the most significant one is a false positive screening test result that leads to invasive and expensive procedures to ultimately find no cancer is present the second is the diagnosis of slow growing cancers that may never cause symptoms a phenomenon called overdiagnosis and overdiagnosis unfortunately can sometimes lead to overtreatment there are also potential societal harms including the unknown financial impact of widespread mced test use before it s known whether they reduce deaths from cancer planning important studies of mced tests the bottom line is we need more research on mced tests that s why nci has been working with leading experts at fda and outside of the government on screening and early detection diagnostic testing and other relevant fields to identify the priority areas of need that analysis has led to the identification of several research priorities for example more studies on the underlying basic and clinical science of mced tests are needed that includes studies of how mced tests perform for specific cancers and in different patient populations and the biology and natural history of the biomarkers used in these tests we also need to be able to validate the performance of the mced tests under development along those lines nci is supporting a project led by the alliance for clinical trials in oncology to collect blood samples from people with and without cancer those samples will be used to independently confirm the performance of the mced test s being considered for use in clinical trials along those lines we appreciate the need to perform large clinical trials to help answer some of the most pressing questions about mced tests designing such trials however is a difficult and complex undertaking that s why nci sponsored an october workshop to get feedback from research leaders on how such trials should be designed including what should be the primary measures or endpoints how to evaluate multiple mced tests at the same time the diagnostic work up of positive results and the care of those diagnosed with cancer nci is now using that feedback to guide the design of randomized clinical trials of mced tests researchers in the united kingdom recently launched a large trial of a single mced test there is no immediate timeline for launching a large nci supported trial in the united states although our goal is to launch one that includes multiple mced tests in the next to months yes mced tests hold tremendous promise and it might be frustrating to some to hear that despite their promise we should take the time to learn more about them before they are widely used but that is a responsibility and role that nci is committed to fulfilling in doing so we can help to ensure that the years of research and innovation that led to the development of mced tests can save as many lives as possible older post identifying safer ways to look for recurrence after testicular cancer surgery newer post embryos in the womb can get gene mutations that

april by nci staff mri scans or fewer ct scans can be safely used to monitor for recurrence in people who have undergone surgery for early stage testicular cancer credit istock men who undergo surgery for early stage low risk testicular cancer are then monitored for several years to see if the disease comes back the monitoring often involves regular imaging with ct scans which expose patients to radiation a new study suggests that the routine use of another imaging technology mri which does not require radiation is no less effective than ct scans at ensuring that most relapses are caught before they become advanced the results also suggest that doctors may be able to safely reduce the frequency of ct and mri scans used to monitor these individuals researchers in the united kingdom reported their findings in the journal of clinical oncology on march men who are diagnosed with early stage testicular cancer tend to be relatively young and nearly all will be cured of the disease so doctors try to minimize the potential side effects of treatment and follow up care but the safest way to monitor patients has not been clear noted fay cafferty ph d of the medical research council clinical trials unit at university college london who was the lead statistical researcher for the new study to investigate dr cafferty and her colleagues developed a randomized phase clinical trial which included men who had surgery for early stage seminoma testicular cancer the trial called trisst compared outcomes after four different monitoring approaches seven ct scans over years seven mri scans over years three ct scans over years or three mri scans over years at a median follow up of years the outcomes of patients who received the mri scans and the lower frequency of ct scans were no worse than those of other patients the researchers found overall monitoring detected a relapse in of the men with detected at an advanced stage at years after surgery nearly all the participants were still alive with no deaths related to the cancer the researchers found by using mri instead of ct and or reducing the number of scans we can still detect relapses at an early stage when they can be successfully treated said dr cafferty these approaches can reduce exposure to potentially harmful radiation for these patients while still providing effective monitoring in case their cancers return limiting cumulative radiation dose although rare testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men aged to because these patients are young and will be followed for so long we worry about the cumulative radiation dose from ct scans said samuel haywood m d a urologist at the cleveland clinic who was not involved in the uk study in trisst men who received the longer schedule had scans every months for the first years and then once a year for the next years the shorter schedule included scans only at and months a testicular tumor outlined in pink on an mri scan credit scientific data august https doi org s z cc by among the men who had relapses all but occurred within years which suggests that scanning beyond that time may not be necessary the research team wrote we found that the benefit of having continued ct scans beyond years was outweighed by the potentially harmful exposure to radiation given the small number of men who relapsed after years and our success at treating those patients who had relapsed said study coauthor robert huddart m d ph d of the institute of cancer research london in a press release regardless of the imaging frequency or type used to monitor patients few had advanced stage disease at relapse the study authors found of the relapses found at an advanced stage occurred in the scan groups compared with in the scan group only of the relapses could have potentially been detected earlier with seven scans the researchers noted weighing the potential risks benefits of additional scans a potential limitation of the study was that the trial included only men with a relatively low risk of recurrence the findings therefore might not apply to men with a higher risk for relapse according to dr cafferty dr haywood expects that the uk study findings may help shape decisions in the united states about how doctors monitor patients after surgery for early stage seminoma testicular cancer in the united states the most recent national comprehensive cancer network guidelines recommend patients receive four ct scans over the first years the trisst results suggest that we may be able to safely reduce the follow up monitoring and change the type of scan our patients receive said dr haywood he cautioned however that mri technology and the expertise needed to read mri scans are less widely available than for ct scans another concern of dr haywood s is that with less frequent monitoring some patients might lose touch with the physicians who have been following them after treatment in addition mris tend to be more expensive than cts so it remains to be seen if insurance would cover this change dr haywood added dr cafferty and her colleagues are undertaking an analysis of health economic data to gain insights into the potential costs of less intensive monitoring approaches in the united kingdom given the costs associated with mri additional evidence is needed to support the use of this technology the study authors wrote we hope that the current findings will change how monitoring is done said dr cafferty reducing the number of scans and particularly not scanning beyond years will not only reduce radiation exposure but will also reduce the burden of hospital visits for patients and for hospitals older post implanted drug factories deliver cancer treatment directly to tumors newer post screening for many

nci staff enlarge some immune and nonimmune cells release signaling molecules called cytokines including il and others that modify the immune response credit adapted from cancers november https doi org cancers cc by researchers have developed tiny drug factories that can be implanted near tumors in the abdominal cavity to fight cancer a new study in mice shows the drug factories which produce an immune boosting molecule called interleukin il eliminated tumors in mouse models of ovarian and colorectal cancer clinical testing of this approach in people with ovarian cancer is expected to start later this year said the study s senior investigator omid veiseh ph d a bioengineer at rice university il a type of molecule known as a cytokine is a known potent activator of t cells the fighter cells of the immune system and boosts their normal ability to eliminate cancer cells said amanda nash the study s lead researcher and a graduate student in dr veiseh s lab indeed a laboratory made form of il proleukin was the first immunotherapy approved to treat cancer in but its use in patients has been limited by the severe side effects that occur when the drug is given intravenously and reaches the entire body by contrast the implanted drug factories delivered high levels of il where it was needed near the tumors while keeping blood levels of il low in the experimental mice the research team reported march in science advances this study offers one approach to providing il in a way that limits its toxicity and maximizes its cancer fighting effects said james gulley m d ph d a cancer immunotherapy expert in nci s center for cancer research who was not involved in the new study but clinical trials will be needed to test the safety and effectiveness of this approach in patients engineered cells deliver il where it s needed to create the drug factories dr veiseh s team began with human retinal cells grown in the lab among other features these cells are relatively easy to manipulate genetically the team engineered these cells to produce the natural form of il each factory is a pinhead sized bead of roughly cells enclosed in a protective gel like material called alginate the researchers implanted the beads in the peritoneal cavity the space that encloses the abdominal and pelvic organs of mice they were able to control the dose of il by varying the number of beads that were implanted levels of the cytokine in the peritoneal cavity were at least times higher than those in the blood they found confirming that the il delivered by the factories remained local the beads pump out the drug daily for about to days and then they shut off and if needed we can safely readminister more beads dr veiseh said implanting the beads eradicated tumors in of animals in a mouse model of advanced ovarian cancer and of animals in a mouse model of aggressive colorectal cancer both ovarian and colorectal cancer often spread to other parts of the peritoneal cavity in these mouse models as in people mice with ovarian cancer that were implanted with il producing beads also survived longer than both untreated mice and mice treated with lab made il that was directly infused into the peritoneal cavity beads recruit t cells to kill tumors additional mouse experiments showed that the ability of the beads to shrink or eliminate tumors largely reflected the activation and increased number of tumor targeting immune cells called killer t cells like normal il the factories also increased the numbers of other immune cells including natural killer cells that work hand in hand with killer t cells to destroy cancer cells dr gulley noted each of the drug factory beads is composed of roughly cells enclosed in a protective gel like material credit used with permission from rice university in addition to allowing high levels of il to be delivered locally another potential advantage of the implantable beads dr veiseh said is that unlike the lab made form of il they don t trigger the formation of antibodies that can attack and neutralize the cytokine and that should make it safe to give repeated doses although the alginate enclosing the beads is safe for human use it is seen as foreign by the immune system and appears to intensify the immune response against tumors ms nash said we believe that if you give il locally just by itself without alginate the immune response won t be substantial enough to fully eradicate tumors in the intraperitoneal space she continued drug factories lead to distant as well as local effects using the mouse model of aggressive colorectal cancer the team found that implanting il producing beads in the peritoneal cavity not only eliminated the original tumor but also prevented new tumors of the same type from forming elsewhere in the body suggesting that the beads could potentially also stop cancers from spreading or metastasizing these effects on far flung tumors were due to memory t cells immune cells that remain in the body for a long time and can help keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body or coming back after initial treatment when il stimulates t cells to fight the cancer cells the memory t cells learn what that specific tumor looks like so if the cancer returns these cells already know how to get rid of the tumor ms nash explained that s how we believe and hope our approach will work in patients but ultimately we will have to run clinical trials to test that dr veiseh noted he said that such effects on distant tumors could potentially allow the beads to be used to treat cancers that aren t confined to the peritoneal space such as lung cancer and mesothelioma dr veiseh is the cofounder of a company avenge bio formed to commercialize the drug factory technology he and ms nash have a financial interest in the company the company hopes to launch the first clinical trial of the technology for people with ovarian cancer later this year and another trial for people with lung cancer and mesothelioma in in preparation for the trials the team also showed that implanted beads producing the human version of il appeared to be safe and well tolerated in nonhuman primates although the ability to place the beads locally avoids the problems associated with systemic delivery of il dr gulley noted that placing them would involve at least minor surgery dr veiseh said that existing imaging guided methods could be used to inject the beads through a surgically implanted narrow tube we hope that the benefits are so substantial that it is worth this additional complication he added other researchers have developed different ways of delivering il and other cytokines directly to tumors to minimize side effects dr gulley noted such as linking the cytokine to a tumor targeting antibody it s unclear which of these approaches will be safest and most effective against different cancers dr gulley said we will need to test multiple parallel approaches in clinical trials to find out not limited to delivering il a benefit of the drug factory technology is its versatility dr veiseh explained the factory design itself can be leveraged to produce other cytokines that have shown clinical benefit against cancer and we hope to use our platform to deliver those cytokines directly to tumors as well dr veiseh said ultimately dr gulley said it may be possible to get better results in some patients by combining cytokines with other types of immunotherapy including drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors that can help t cells kill cancer cells better for example he explained center for cancer research investigators are currently leading three trials in people with cancers that are not considered to be responsive to immunotherapy including prostate and colorectal cancer that are testing combinations of cytokines and other immunotherapies and we are seeing good levels of response he said however dr gulley continued we re first going to need to see data on the safety of this drug factory approach alone and then potentially combination approaches could be tested older post opdualag becomes first fda approved immunotherapy to target lag newer post

bristol myers squibb which manufactures nivolumab and relatlimab sponsored the trial the researchers measured how long patients lived without their disease worsening or dying from any cause whichever came first progression free survival with a median follow up of months patients who received nivolumab and relatlimab had longer progression free survival than patients who received nivolumab alone months versus months among the patients who received nivolumab and relatlimab the most common side effects were fatigue rash aching or painful joints and diarrhea of this group of the patients stopped treatment because of side effects compared with of the nivolumab alone group the results of this study are quite impressive said elad sharon m d who helps lead immunotherapy trials in nci s cancer therapy evaluation program but was not involved in the research dr sharon cautioned however that longer follow up is needed to show whether the new combination improves how long patients live overall survival compared with other treatments expanding the number of immune checkpoint inhibitors additional drugs targeting lag are being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma esophageal or gastric cancer and chordoma among other types of cancers and opdualag is also being studied in clinical trials of other cancers including lung colorectal and liver cancer the nci match trial recently added a new treatment group to evaluate opdualag in patients whose cancers have progressed after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors that target pd or its binding partner on cancer cells pd l combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors may be more effective than an individual immune checkpoint inhibitor for treating certain cancers studies have shown for example nivolumab and ipilimumab yervoy which blocks a checkpoint protein on immune cells called ctla is more effective than nivolumab alone for treating melanoma that has spread to the brain the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is a standard treatment for previously untreated inoperable or metastatic melanoma in terms of progression free survival the combinations of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and of relatlimab plus nivolumab have yielded similar results in clinical trials however the relatlimab nivolumab regimen appears to be associated with fewer side effects than the nivolumab ipilimumab regimen less than of patients who received relatlimab nivolumab reported serious side effects compared with nearly patients who received nivolumab ipilimumab noted the authors of an editorial accompanying the relativity results in the new england journal of medicine given the different safety profiles of these regimens said dr sharon it will be interesting to see over time if the nivolumab and relatlimab combination improves overall survival compared with nivolumab and ipilimumab longer follow up data from the relativity trial he added are needed to help patients and physicians select from various treatment

melanoma cells green and blue in the brain being enveloped by astrocytes orange branches credit copyright american association for cancer research all rights reserved a protein called amyloid beta is infamous as a likely contributor to the development of alzheimer s disease clumps of it called plaques are found throughout the brains of people who develop the cognitive symptoms of alzheimer s and now results from a new study in mice by nci funded researchers published march in cancer discovery suggest that amyloid beta also plays a role in the spread metastasis of melanoma to the brain the researchers found that melanoma cells that travel to the brain produce their own supply of amyloid beta and that this protein is necessary for their survival they also showed how amyloid beta achieves this feat by tamping down the body s normal immune response against cancer cells that make it into the brain in fending off the immune response the protein buys the cancer cells time to grow into full fledged tumors treating the mice with drugs that block the protein greatly reduced melanoma cells ability to survive in the brain these results the researchers said raise the intriguing possibility of using drugs developed to treat alzheimer s to slow or stop melanoma from spreading to the brain other research groups have also found intriguing connections between cancer that has spread to the brain and neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson s disease explained eva hernando monge ph d of nyu grossman school of medicine who led the new study so we re trying to understand if these connections might present new treatment opportunities dr hernando monge said tumor cells with an affinity for the brain among all cancer types melanoma is especially likely to spread to the brain studies estimate that between to of people whose melanoma spreads will end up with one or more brain metastases the symptoms of these tumors which can include seizures vision and hearing problems and difficulty thinking and remembering can be devastating a cancer diagnosis is often a traumatic event inducing a major lifestyle disruption said brunilde gril ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who was not involved with the study brain metastases affecting cognitive functions touch the identity and sense of self of the person adding another layer of emotional and functional challenges currently there are no therapies to prevent melanoma from taking hold in the brain clinical trials of immunotherapies for advanced melanoma have shown some success in shrinking brain metastases said dr hernando monge they work to a certain extent there s some reduction in the size of the tumors but these responses don t last she explained her team has been studying the mechanisms that cancer cells use to spread to and thrive in the brain for this study the team started with a technique called unbiased proteomics analysis this approach makes it possible to look at the complete set of proteins produced by cells without making any assumptions in advance about what will be found using this approach the researchers compared samples from melanoma that had spread to other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes of lungs with samples from the same patients brain metastases the comparison showed that the cells taken from the brain had different patterns of expression of proteins that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimer s parkinson s and huntington s diseases these included proteins known to be involved in amyloid beta production quieting the immune response in the brain the team next performed a series of experiments using cancer cells that could and couldn t produce amyloid beta the results including from tests in mice seemed to confirm that the melanoma cells could spread to other organs without the protein but that it was needed for the cells to establish tumors in the brain in another set of mouse experiments that tracked the timeline of melanoma metastasis to the brain the team found that individual melanoma cells lacking amyloid beta could spread to the brain and survive there for about a week but they didn t grow into larger metastatic tumors to reach and colonize the brain cancer cells need to overcome several hostile environments explained dr gril the cells start their journey by leaving the primary tumor they then need to survive in the blood stream cross a structure known as the blood brain barrier and then successfully incorporate themselves among other brain cells to grow as a secondary tumor in mouse brains and in cultured cells taken from rat brains dr hernando monge and her team found that the amyloid beta produced by melanoma cells interacts directly with a type of brain cell called an astrocyte that interaction did several things they found including preventing immune cells in the brain called microglia from recognizing and killing the cancer cells can alzheimer s drugs be repurposed to prevent brain metastases taken together these results raised the possibility that blocking amyloid beta could prevent melanoma from spreading to the brain so in their final experiments the researchers injected mice with human melanoma cells once tumors were established they gave the mice a compound that blocks the generation of amyloid beta as hoped the compound helped reduce the formation of tumors in the brain this effect was seen regardless of whether the drug was given before or after the cells had already crossed the blood brain barrier the study only scratches the surface of understanding how cancer cells in the brain use amyloid beta said kevin kleffman a doctoral student in the hernando monge lab who led the study melanoma cells may be exploiting a process involved in stopping long term inflammation after a brain injury or some other process involved in repairing damaged brain cells although more work is needed to understand the breadth of these interactions dr hernando monge stressed that there s no direct link between melanoma and the development of alzheimer s disease alzheimer s is associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta into plaques we don t see that in our melanoma models and we don t see that in patients with melanoma she said but because amyloid beta has been the subject of intense interest in alzheimer s disease research several drugs that block the protein have been developed as possible treatments for alzheimer s these drugs have shown disappointing results in stopping or slowing alzheimer s itself however because they ve proven very safe in large human studies dr hernando monge explained they can easily be tested in human studies of other diseases additional research would need to be done before trying such drugs in people with melanoma the research team explained such studies include testing whether they would be safe in combination with the immunotherapy drugs that are now standard treatments for melanoma eventually the researchers hope to examine whether amyloid beta is needed for other types of cancer to spread to the brain as well as for the growth of primary brain tumors such as glioblastoma brain metastases can be devastating not only for people with melanoma but for people with other cancers that tend to metastasize to the brain including breast and lung cancer said dr hernando monge if amyloid beta is needed for other cancer types to spread to the brain this knowledge could be applied to a larger set of patients additional research in this area may also help scientists better understand some aspects of neurodegenerative diseases said dr gril we often get the most insight from breaking down research silos between diseases and making connections between them older post carvykti approval

nci staff the two car t cell therapies approved by fda for treating multiple myeloma bind to the bcma protein blue on the surface of myeloma cells credit adapted from frontiers in immunology august https doi org fimmu cc by patients with advanced multiple myeloma now have a second option for car t cell therapy a type of personalized immunotherapy on february the food and drug administration fda approved ciltacabtagene autoleucel carvykti for adults with multiple myeloma that is not responding to treatment refractory or has returned after treatment relapsed under the approval ciltacabtagene autoleucel also called cilta cel can be taken by people who have already received four or more lines of therapy including treatment with three major classes of multiple myeloma drugs an immunomodulating agent a proteasome inhibitor and an anti cd monoclonal antibody the approval was based on results from a small clinical trial in which cilta cel reduced the amount of cancer in nearly every participant and for many kept their cancer in check for more than a year like the first fda approved car t cell therapy for multiple myeloma cilta cel targets a protein on myeloma cells called bcma although we do have a lot of treatment options for myeloma for the majority of patients the disease still comes back after each treatment said faith davies m d director of the center for blood cancers at nyu langone health s perlmutter cancer center once the available treatments have been exhausted patients typically live less than a year so having another therapeutic approach in our toolbox is so important dr davies added car t cell therapy works in a completely different way than our standard treatments and therefore it offers a different way of killing drug resistant myeloma cells which really is the key she said but cost availability and the time it takes to manufacture the treatment are limiting factors for car t cell therapy cilta cel has a list price of for a one time infusion although the final cost to a patient will depend on their insurance coverage cilta cel is currently only available at a limited number of hospitals that are certified to offer the complex treatment though additional hospitals will be added to the list as the manufacturer janssen pharmaceutical scales up production according to a company press release plus it takes around month to make the personalized treatment a wait time that may be too long for some patients with very aggressive cancer impressive results with cilta cel multiple myeloma is a cancer of blood cells that make antibodies the cancer can form tumors in the bones and other organs the fda approval was based on findings from cartitude an ongoing clinical trial evaluating cilta cel in people with multiple myeloma who had already received multiple treatments the study participants received a single infusion of cilta cel nearly all of them responded to the treatment meaning it reduced the amount of cancer in their body at least partially for of participants there were no signs of the cancer in their bone marrow or blood on sophisticated tests what s called a stringent complete response overall responses lasted for a median of months to compare other drugs to date that have been approved for multiple myeloma were in the neighborhood of a response rate said the trial s lead investigator sundar jagannath m d of the tisch cancer institute in new york for patients who have already received multiple lines of therapy having response rates nearing is absolutely unprecedented and is amazing dr davies said and to have responses that lasted for close to years is very impressive she added importantly dr jagannath noted patients typically don t need additional cancer treatments while they are in remission after cilta cel most of them have been constantly on treatment because continuous therapy is important for myeloma he explained for many the interval after cilta cel treatment is their first real break from cancer treatment since being diagnosed which greatly improves their quality of life and well being he said what are the side effects of cilta cel cilta cel led to side effects that are typical for a car t cell therapy such as cytokine release syndrome infections and nerve problems like pain or tingling neuropathy it didn t appear to cause any different side effects compared with other car t cell therapies so that s a good thing dr davies said side effect frequency cytokine release syndrome infections low blood platelet count low neutrophil count nerve problems low antibody levels some side effects appeared days or weeks after the cilta cel infusion in addition there were seven deaths attributed to the treatment cytokine release syndrome is caused when revved up car t cells dump inflammatory signals into the blood leading to flu like symptoms although nearly all of the study participants had cytokine release syndrome the majority of those cases were mild and treatable with steroids or other medicines we have all learned how to handle cytokine release syndrome better as experience has improved safety has increased dr jagannath explained cilta cel comes with a boxed warning for six potentially life threatening or fatal side effects including hlh mas hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis macrophage activation syndrome a condition also caused by inflammatory signals from car t cells hlh leads to dangerously low blood pressure and multiorgan dysfunction but can be treated if recognized early there is also a boxed warning for guillain barre syndrome and parkinsonism a condition with symptoms that are similar to parkinson s disease such as tremors and slow movement the research team put a mitigation plan in place for parkinsonism dr jagannath explained which appears to be helping to reduce the condition in ongoing studies the other warnings are for severe cytokine release syndrome prolonged periods of low blood counts and icans immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome a neurologic syndrome that causes alterations in consciousness and problems with brain function two options for car t cell therapy to make cilta cel a patient s own immune cells are collected and genetically modified to be able to find and kill cancer cells the souped up immune cells called car t cells home in on bcma a protein found in high amounts on multiple myeloma cells and a very small subset of healthy blood cells idecabtagene vicleucel abecma or ide cel was the first car t cell therapy to be fda approved for multiple myeloma ide cel also targets bcma but cilta cel differs slightly in that the car t cells grab onto two sections of bcma rather than one now that there are two car t cell therapy options the big question everyone is asking dr davies said is what are the differences and potential benefits of one over the other it s too early to know that answer but the most important thing dr jagannath said is that both car t therapies work well both are serving and helping patients right now the option will simply come down to which one is available dr davies added the demand for ide cel was so huge we weren t able to meet it so being able to have a second car t cell therapy available to use is so important she said the possibility of a cure according to dr davies there s another big question about car t cell therapy for multiple myeloma given that the therapies work well for people who have had four or more treatments would they work even better for people who have had fewer or no prior treatments these therapies work by using the patient s natural immune system and with myeloma by the time patients receive four therapies their immune system is a little bit beat up she explained a patient who is newly diagnosed and hasn t received any treatment yet probably has an immune system that is in better shape she said another potential advantage of treating newly diagnosed patients with the car t cell therapy dr jagannath said is that they are less likely to have cancer cells that are resistant to the treatment dr davies mused there s a lot of discussion about if we were to use these therapies earlier in the disease course would patients maybe have better responses longer responses and in some cases be cured older post darolutamide extends survival for some people with metastatic prostate

proliferate credit adapted from cancers feb https doi org cancers cc by the drug darolutamide nubeqa could become part of the standard treatment for some men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer based on results from a large clinical trial in the trial men with hormone sensitive prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of the body or metastasized were treated with either darolutamide plus two other therapies docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy adt or only docetaxel and adt substantially more men who received all three treatments were still alive years after starting treatment than those treated with only docetaxel and adt and adding darolutamide didn t lead to more intense side effects data from the arasens trial were published in the new england journal of medicine and presented at the american society of clinical oncology asco genitourinary cancers symposium on february based on the results of arasens we conclude that darolutamide in combination with adt and docetaxel should become a new standard of care for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer said the study s lead investigator matthew r smith m d ph d of massachusetts general hospital cancer center during the meeting fatima karzai m d of nci s genitourinary malignancies branch agreed calling the results practice changing arasens was funded by bayer and orion pharma the co manufacturers of darolutamide bayer has submitted an application to the food and drug administration to expand the drug s approval to include people with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer the drug is currently only approved for people with nonmetastatic prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone therapy hormone resistant an evolving standard of care hormone sensitive also called castration sensitive prostate cancer means a patient s tumors are still largely being fueled by male sex hormones called androgens for many years metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer was treated with adt alone which blocks the production of androgens by the testicles in a large clinical trial showed that adding the chemotherapy drug docetaxel to adt improved survival in men with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer since then this combination has become the standard of care for this group of patients more recently studies have shown that adding other drugs that block the production or binding of androgens including abiraterone zytiga enzalutamide xtandi and apalutamide erleada to adt also helps people with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer live longer in a trial combining apalutamide with adt for example approximately of men were still alive after years compared with of men treated with adt alone several clinical trials were then launched to see if combining any of these drugs with adt and docetaxel could build on those survival gains results of those studies however have been mixed with one showing an improvement in survival without the disease progressing and another finding no increase in overall survival like other androgen receptor inhibitors darolutamide works by blocking androgens from binding to receptors on cancer cells unlike other androgen receptor inhibitors however darolutamide does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain which may be why studies have found fewer central nervous system related side effects e g seizures with darolutamide than with other such drugs the trio of darolutamide adt and docetaxel has already been shown to improve survival in men with hormone resistant prostate cancer that has not spread so arasens was launched to see if it could do the same in men with prostate cancer that has spread improved survival at years in the arasens trial nearly participants were randomly assigned to receive darolutamide or a placebo both taken as a pill twice a day all participants received adt within weeks before randomization and six cycles of docetaxel starting within weeks after randomization after years about of patients who received darolutamide were still alive compared with about of patients who received placebo the group that received darolutamide lived longer even though most participants in the placebo group received other commonly used treatments including abiraterone and enzalutamide during follow up darolutamide resulted in other improvements as well for example among those treated with darolutamide the time for their cancers to become resistant to hormone suppressing therapies was longer as was the time until the pain caused by their cancer got worse the frequency of serious side effects which included fatigue falls fractures and cardiac issues was similar in the two groups roughly two thirds of the patients in both groups experienced serious side effects most of which occurred when darolutamide or placebo were given at the same time as docetaxel more options lead to more questions elisabeth heath m d director of prostate cancer research at karmanos cancer institute in detroit agreed that the arasens results should have an immediate impact on how this form of the disease is treated speaking at the asco symposium dr heath who was not involved in the study highlighted an important difference between arasens and other trials that tested androgen receptor blocking drugs in men with this form of prostate cancer in those other trials she explained some participants received docetaxel prior to treatment with the androgen receptor blocking drugs rather than at the same time based on the arasens results dr heath said giving all three treatments simultaneously looks to be the preferred option for some patients dr karzai noted that despite there being multiple options to treat metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer many questions remain we don t have guidelines on who should start with what drug and whether one drug is better than another for a specific patient she said she also pointed out that more research is needed on how the order in which the drugs are given impact their effectiveness and the frequency of side effects additionally she said the survival improvement in the arasens trial was seen in patients whose cancer had spread in multiple areas beyond the prostate known as high volume disease we don t know if people with lower volume disease would benefit from the addition of darolutamide as much as the patients with higher volume disease do she said you have to really think about the group with lower volume disease do you want to give them this therapy that causes side effects when you don t know if they are going to get the survival benefit and the other secondary benefits like the high volume group does she said dr smith said that future studies could look at whether darolutamide and adt alone could improve survival as well as darolutamide adt and docetaxel removing docetaxel from the combination could reduce some of the side effects he said

staff a deep learning algorithm trained to analyze images from mri scans predicts the presence of an idh gene mutation in brain tumors credit ca cancer j clin march april doi caac cc by two identical black and white pictures of murky shapes sit side by side on a computer screen on the left side ismail baris turkbey m d a radiologist with years of experience has outlined an area where the fuzzy shapes represent what he believes is a creeping growing prostate cancer on the other side of the screen an artificial intelligence ai computer program has done the same and the results are nearly identical the black and white image is an mri scan from someone with prostate cancer and the ai program has analyzed thousands of them the ai model finds the prostate and outlines cancer suspicious areas without any human supervision dr turkbey explains his hope is that the ai will help less experienced radiologists find prostate cancer when it s present and dismiss anything that may be mistaken for cancer this model is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the intersection of artificial intelligence and cancer research while the potential applications seem endless a lot of that progress has centered around tools for cancer imaging from x rays of whole organs to microscope pictures of cancer cells doctors use imaging tests in many ways finding cancer at its earliest stages determining the stage of a tumor seeing if treatment is working and monitoring whether cancer has returned after treatment over the past several years researchers have developed ai tools that have the potential to make cancer imaging faster more accurate and even more informative and that s generated a lot of excitement there s a lot of hype around ai but there s a lot of research that s going into it as well said stephanie harmon ph d a data scientist in nci s molecular imaging branch that research experts say includes addressing questions about whether these tools are ready to leave research labs and enter doctors offices whether they will actually help patients and whether that benefit will reach all or only some patients what is artificial intelligence artificial intelligence refers to computer programs or algorithms that use data to make decisions or predictions to build an algorithm scientists might create a set of rules or instructions for the computer to follow so it can analyze data and make a decision for example dr turkbey and his colleagues used existing rules about how prostate cancer appears on an mri scan they then trained their algorithm using thousands of mri studies some from people known to have prostate cancer and some from people who did not with other artificial intelligence approaches like machine learning the algorithm teaches itself how to analyze and interpret data as such machine learning algorithms may pick up on patterns that are not readily discernable to the human eye or brain and as these algorithms are exposed to more new data their ability to learn and interpret the data improves researchers have also used deep learning a type of machine learning in cancer imaging applications deep learning refers to algorithms that classify information in ways much like the human brain does deep learning tools use artificial neural networks that mimic how our brain cells take in process and react to signals from the rest of our body research on ai for cancer imaging doctors use cancer imaging tests to answer a range of questions like is it cancer or a harmless lump if it is cancer how fast is it growing how far has it spread is it growing back after treatment studies suggest that ai has the potential to improve the speed accuracy and reliability with which doctors answer those questions artificial intelligence aids brain tumor diagnosis approach diagnoses cancer in under minutes during surgery ai can automate assessments and tasks that humans currently can do but take a lot of time said hugo aerts ph d of harvard medical school after the ai gives a result a radiologist simply needs to review what the ai has done did it make the correct assessment dr aerts continued that automation is expected to save time and costs but that still needs to be proven he added in addition ai could make image interpretation a highly subjective task more straightforward and reliable dr aerts noted complex tasks that rely on a human making an interpretation of an image say a radiologist a dermatologist a pathologist that s where we see enormous breakthroughs being made with deep learning he said but what scientists are most excited about is the potential for ai to go beyond what humans can currently do themselves ai can see things that we humans can t and can find complex patterns and relationships between very different kinds of data ai is great at doing this at going beyond human performance for a lot of tasks dr aerts said but in this case it is often unclear how the ai reaches its conclusion so it s difficult for doctors and researchers to check if the tool is performing correctly finding cancer early tests like mammograms and pap tests are used to regularly check people for signs of cancer or precancerous cells that can turn into cancer the goal is to catch and treat cancer early before it spreads or even before it forms at all scientists have developed ai tools to aid screening tests for several kinds of cancer including breast cancer ai based computer programs have been used to help doctors interpret mammograms for more than years but research in this area is quickly evolving one group created an ai algorithm that can help determine how often someone should get screened for breast cancer the model uses a person s mammogram images to predict their risk of developing breast cancer in the next years in various tests the model was more accurate than the current tools used to predict breast cancer risk nci researchers have built and tested a deep learning algorithm that can identify cervical precancers that should be removed or treated in some low resource settings health workers screen for cervical precancer by inspecting the cervix with a small camera although this method is simple and sustainable it is not very reliable or accurate mark schiffman m d m p h of nci s division of cancer epidemiology and genetics and his colleagues designed an algorithm to improve the ability to find cervical precancers with the visual inspection method in a study the algorithm performed better than trained experts for colon cancer several ai tools have been shown in clinical trials to improve the detection of precancerous growths called adenomas however because only a small percentage of adenomas turn into cancer some experts are concerned that such ai tools could lead to unnecessary treatments and extra tests for many patients detecting cancer ai has also shown the potential to improve cancer detection in people who have symptoms the ai model developed by dr turkbey and his colleagues in nci s center for cancer research for instance could make it easier for radiologists to pick out potentially aggressive prostate cancer on a relatively new kind of prostate mri scan called multiparametric mri on a multiparametric mri scan of a patient s prostate a cancer suspicious area red is highlighted by an ai model developed by dr turkbey credit courtesy of stephanie harmon ph d although multiparametric mri generates a more detailed picture of the prostate than a regular mri radiologists typically need years of practice to read these scans accurately leading to disagreements between radiologists looking at the same scan the nci team s ai model can make the learning curve easier for practicing radiologists and can minimize the error rate dr turkbey said the ai model could serve as a virtual expert to guide less experienced radiologists learning to use multiparametric mri he added for lung cancer several deep learning ai models have been developed to help doctors find lung cancer on ct scans some noncancerous changes in the lungs look a lot like cancer on ct scans leading to a high rate of false positive test results that indicate a person has lung cancer when they really don t experts think that ai may better distinguish lung cancer from noncancerous changes on ct scans potentially cutting the number of false positives and sparing some people from unneeded stress follow up tests and procedures for example a team of researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to find lung cancer and to specifically avoid other changes that look like cancer in lab tests the algorithm was very good at ignoring noncancerous changes that look like cancer and good at finding cancer choosing cancer treatment doctors also use imaging tests to get important information about cancer such as how fast it is growing whether it has spread and whether it is likely to come back after treatment this information can help doctors choose the most appropriate treatment for their patients a number of studies suggest that ai has the potential to gather such prognostic information and maybe even more from imaging scans and with greater precision than humans currently can for example dr harmon and her colleagues created a deep learning model that can determine the likelihood that a patient with bladder cancer might need other treatments in addition to surgery doctors estimate that around of people with tumors in the bladder muscle muscle invasive bladder cancer have clusters of cancer cells that have spread beyond the bladder but are too small to detect with traditional tools if these hidden cells aren t removed they can continue growing after surgery causing a relapse chemotherapy can kill these microscopic clusters and prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery but clinical trials have shown that it s hard to determine which patients need chemotherapy in addition to surgery dr harmon said what we would like to do is use this model before patients undergo any sort of treatment to tell which patients have cancer with a high likelihood of spreading so doctors can make informed decisions she explained dr harmon s ai model uses digital images of a bladder tumor tissue sample input on the left to predict the risk of the cancer spreading to nearby lymph nodes output on the right credit courtesy of stephanie harmon ph d the model looks at digital images of primary tumor tissue to predict whether there are microscopic clusters of cancer in nearby lymph nodes in a study the deep learning model proved to be more accurate than the standard way of predicting whether bladder cancer has spread which is based on a combination of factors including the patient s age and certain characteristics of the tumor more and more genetic information about the patients cancer is being used to help select the most appropriate treatment scientists in china created a deep learning tool to predict the presence of key gene mutations from images of liver cancer tissue something pathologists can t do by just looking at the images their tool is an example of ai that works in mysterious ways the scientists who built the algorithm don t know how it senses which gene mutations are present in the tumor are ai tools for cancer imaging ready for the real world although scientists are churning out ai tools for cancer imaging the field is still nascent and many questions about the practical applications of these tools remain unanswered using ai to classify lung cancer types the computer program can differentiate the two most common forms of lung cancer while hundreds of algorithms have been proven accurate in early tests most haven t reached the next phase of testing that ensures they are ready for the real world dr harmon said that testing known as external or independent validation tells us how generalizable our algorithm is meaning how useful is it on a totally new patient how does it perform on patients from different medical centers or different scanners dr harmon explained in other words does the ai tool work accurately beyond the data it was trained on ai algorithms that pass rigorous validation testing in diverse groups of people from various areas of the world could be used more widely and therefore help more people she added in addition to validation dr turkbey noted clinical studies also need to show that ai tools actually help patients either by preventing people from getting cancer helping them live longer or have a better quality of life or saving them time or money but even after that dr aerts said a major question about ai is how do we make sure that these algorithms keep on working and performing well for years and years for example he said new scanners could change features of the image that an ai tool relies on to make predictions or interpretations he explained and that could change their performance there are also questions about how ai tools will be regulated upwards of ai based medical devices or algorithms have earned fda approval as of but even after they are approved some machine learning algorithms shift as they are exposed to new data in fda issued a framework for monitoring ai technologies that have the ability to adapt there are also concerns about the transparency of some ai tools with some algorithms like the one that can predict gene mutations in liver tumors scientists don t know how it reaches its conclusion a conundrum known as the black box problem experts say this lack of transparency prohibits critical checks for biases and inaccuracies a recent study for example showed that a machine learning algorithm trained to predict cancer outcomes zeroed in on the hospital where the tumor image was taken rather than the patient s tumor biology although that algorithm isn t used in any medical settings other tools trained in the same way could have the same inaccuracy the researchers warned there are also worries that ai could worsen gaps in health outcomes between privileged and disadvantaged groups by exacerbating biases that are already baked into our medical system and research processes said irene dankwa mullan m d m p h deputy chief health equity officer of ibm watson health these biases are deeply embedded in the data used to create ai models she explained at the american association for cancer research science of cancer health disparities conference for instance a handful of medical algorithms have recently been shown to be less accurate for black people than for white people these potentially dangerous shortcomings stem from the fact that the algorithms were mainly trained and validated on data from white patients experts have noted on the other hand some experts think ai could improve access to cancer care by bringing expert level care to hospitals that lack specialists what ai can do is in a setting where there are physicians who maybe don t have as much expertise potentially it can bring their performance up to an expert level explained dr harmon some ai tools could even bypass the need for sophisticated equipment the deep learning algorithm for cervical cancer screening developed by dr schiffman for example relies on cell phones or digital cameras and low cost materials despite these concerns most researchers are optimistic for the future of ai in cancer care dr aerts for example believes these hurdles are surmountable with more work and collaboration between experts in science medicine government and community implementation i think ai technologies will eventually be introduced into the clinic because the performance is just too good and it s a waste if we don t he said older post new on nci s websites for march newer post

contracts careers visitor information search search home news events cancer currents blog cancer currents blog severe side effects of cancer treatment are more common in women than men subscribe march by nci staff additional research is needed to understand why women are more likely than men to experience serious side effects from cancer treatments several researchers said credit istock women are more likely than men to experience severe side effects from cancer treatments such as chemotherapy targeted therapy and immunotherapy a new study suggests overall women had a higher risk of severe side effects compared with men the researchers found the sex disparity in severe side effects was the most pronounced among patients receiving immunotherapy with women having a nearly increased risk of serious side effects compared with men the findings are based on several decades of data from cancer clinical trials conducted within the nci sponsored swog cancer research network the trials involved more than men and women the greater severity of side effects in women suggests that when it comes to cancer treatment broad based sex differences exist the study team concluded findings from the study were published february in the journal of clinical oncology researchers have known that women have an increased risk of side effects from chemotherapy but few studies have tested whether the pattern holds for newer treatments such as immunotherapies and targeted therapies this study is a call to action for researchers to dig deeper into possible sex differences associated with cancer therapies said the study s lead investigator joseph unger ph d of the fred hutchinson cancer research center the study was conducted by the swog cancer research network and was supported in part by nci more research is needed dr unger continued to better understand the reasons for the sex differences reported in the study the new results confirm what has been seen in smaller studies noted berna zdemir m d ph d of bern university hospital switzerland who studies sex differences in cancer development and outcomes but was not involved in the research the results also underscore the need for personalized treatment approaches that consider the sex of a patient dr zdemir added collecting reports of side effects from large clinical trials to conduct the study the researchers relied on data from patients who participated in large clinical trials that did not involve sex specific or sex dominant e g breast cancers severe side effects also called acute adverse events were reported for all trial participants while on treatment of the patients whose data was included in the study were women and were men numbers that reflect the overall proportions of women and men with cancers that are not sex specific according to dr unger nearly three fourths of the patients had received chemotherapy the others had been treated with either targeted therapy or immunotherapy the researchers collected reports of adverse events that were grade or higher that the patients experienced while on treatment collectively of the patients experienced one or more severe adverse events the study assessed two broad categories of treatment side effects symptomatic such as pain or nausea which are reported by the patient and objective such as high blood pressure which are measured using a laboratory test or a medical instrument or device objective side effects were further categorized as hematologic related to blood or bone marrow or nonhematologic the researchers examined symptomatic and objective categories of adverse events women had a higher risk of severe symptomatic side effects and severe objective hematologic side effects e g anemia neutropenia compared with men women were also more likely than men to experience five or more severe side effects the researchers found among patients receiving immunotherapies women had a increased risk of symptomatic side effects compared with men the differences we found for immunotherapies were quite large said dr unger limitations of the study include the fact that participants in clinical trials tended to be younger and in better health than similar patients who are not treated on a clinical trial according to dr unger and his colleagues making patients sex part of personalized medicine although the reasons for the sex differences in the study are not clear dr unger and his colleagues suggested some possible explanations these include differences in how men and women perceive or report side effects from therapy the doses and administration of therapies and biological differences between the sexes there are a lot of intriguing possible explanations for the findings said dr unger understanding the mechanisms underlying sex differences could potentially lead to new ways of developing and delivering therapies that reduce toxicity particularly among women he added the increased risk of side effects among women revealed by the study is concerning said coauthor lori minasian m d of nci s division for cancer prevention we need to figure out why this is happening the new findings dr minasian continued could also inform future efforts to develop more individualized forms of cancer medicine to date the field of personalized medicine has focused primarily on targeting certain changes in a tumor such as abnormal proteins but the new study underscores the need to consider the whole patient and not just the tumor she said dr unger agreed a patient s sex has not really been considered a component of individualized approaches to cancer medicine he said but if the new findings are confirmed by other groups then perhaps patient sex should be considered gender based versus sex based differences when researchers report a difference between men and women especially when reporting how a patient feels after a treatment there may be confusion about what is caused by gender differences versus sex differences explained sabra klein ph d codirector of the center for women s health sex and gender research at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health sex refers to biological characteristics gender refers to the behaviors occupations access utilization or perceptions in this case about health care that can be defined by our societal or cultural norms dr klein explained previous studies have suggested that men and women may differ in how and whether they report side effects of treatments women may find it more socially acceptable to admit to experiencing pain discomfort or malaise following a treatment which is often perceived as not masculine in our culture said dr klein as a result we cannot dismiss the possible role that gender might play in the data collected for this study but the disparity by sex in the current study was also seen in objectively reported side effects including lab test results which would not be affected by potential differences in how men and women report side effects clearly reporting differences would not explain all of our findings said dr unger there seems to be something biological going on there as well biology has been linked to sex differences in other cancer outcomes including in different treatment responses in brain cancer many biological differences between males and females are associated with sex hormones such as testosterone or estrogen there are sex differences in inflammatory immune responses that contribute to adverse drug reactions as well as sex differences in the metabolism of drugs said dr klein other studies have found sex based disparities in both the response to and side effects of treatments that affect the immune system including vaccines for the flu and antibody based treatments for autoimmune diseases like arthritis the pattern of increased reporting of adverse events among women in the swog study is consistent with the adverse event reporting for vaccines and other drugs dr klein noted creating awareness about side effect differences interest in sex differences and cancer treatments has been growing among researchers dr zdemir is a board member of the european society for medical oncology gender medicine task force which aims to promote research that could lead to a better understanding of sex differences related to cancer and its treatment the research by dr unger s team is very timely dr zdemir said our task force is trying to raise awareness of potential sex differences in cancer incidence the biology of tumors and treatment effects the group is also encouraging oncology professionals to consider sex and gender issues in their education research and practice one of the main lessons of the swog study dr zdemir noted is that researchers conducting clinical trials of cancer therapies need to report results on the effectiveness and safety of treatments according to a patient s sex this knowledge could eventually help inform decisions about which treatments are most appropriate for individual patients and how best to develop and deliver new therapies she added older post trametinib is a new treatment option for rare form

nci staff trametinib now offers a new treatment choice for women with a rare form of ovarian cancer called low grade serous ovarian cancer credit istock new results from a large clinical trial provide the first strong evidence that a rare form of ovarian cancer known as low grade serous ovarian cancer should be treated differently from other forms of the disease the trial involved women with low grade serous ovarian cancer that had come back after earlier treatments participants who received the targeted drug trametinib mekinist lived longer without their cancer progressing than those who received standard treatment trametinib which is taken as a daily pill blocks the activity of a protein called mek that fuels tumor growth previously patients with any type of ovarian cancer were treated with the same chemotherapy when their cancer relapsed or came back explained christina annunziata m d ph d of nci s women s malignancies branch who was not involved in the trial now people with low grade serous ovarian cancer have a new more effective treatment option indeed t his is the first randomized clinical trial to show a benefit of any therapy specifically for women with this rare and understudied form of ovarian cancer said study leader david gershenson m d professor of gynecologic oncology and reproductive medicine at the university of texas md anderson cancer center the findings published february in the lancet are very significant given that there are few effective treatment options for patients with low grade serous ovarian cancer that has recurred said ursula matulonis m d chief of gynecologic oncology at the dana farber cancer institute who also was not involved with the trial however the possible side effects of trametinib which can be severe may factor into how and when this drug is used experts said how low grade serous ovarian cancer differs from most common form low grade serous ovarian cancer which accounts for about of all cases of ovarian cancer has been recognized as a distinct form of ovarian cancer only since compared with the most common form of ovarian cancer known as high grade serous ovarian cancer the low grade form grows more slowly and is more likely to be diagnosed in younger people although it is less likely to respond to chemotherapy than high grade disease people with the low grade form tend to live longer after their diagnosis like other forms of ovarian cancer low grade serous ovarian cancer is often diagnosed when the cancer is at an advanced stage and the cancer will eventually come back or recur in at least of people with advanced disease dr gershenson said if the cancer does recur he said treatment options include several types of chemotherapy hormone therapies which are also used to treat certain types of breast cancer and bevacizumab avastin people may live for a relatively long time after the cancer recurs requiring treatment for most of that time one treatment may work for a while and then when the cancer progresses a person is switched to a new treatment dr gershenson continued targeting underlying tumor biology with trametinib as researchers have learned more about the underlying biology and genetic hallmarks of different cancers including ovarian cancer they have begun developing more targeted therapies designed to block specific proteins that may drive cancer growth in the case of low grade serous ovarian cancer roughly half of all patients have tumors with genetic alterations that rev up the activity of the mek protein fueling tumor growth and spread so when drugs such as trametinib that could block mek activity were developed it made sense to test them in people with low grade serous disease dr gershenson explained trametinib is already approved for treating certain forms of melanoma thyroid cancer and non small cell lung cancer in dr gershenson and others reported results from a small study showing that a different mek targeting drug could shrink tumors in people with low grade serous ovarian cancer these findings set the stage for larger more rigorous studies of mek targeted drugs as treatments for people with this cancer the clinical trial of trametinib known as gog logs was funded in part by nci and conducted in the united states and united kingdom it enrolled people with recurrent low grade serous ovarian cancer half of the trial participants were randomly assigned to receive daily trametinib and half to receive one of five commonly used standard of care treatment options these included the chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and topotecan which are given intravenously and the hormone therapies letrozole and tamoxifen which are given as pills nearly half of all study participants had received three or more prior therapies for their cancer people in the trametinib group survived for a median of months without dying or having their cancer progress compared with just over months in the standard of care group in addition tumors in of people in the trametinib group shrank in response to treatment compared with only of those in the standard of care group side effects of trametinib a concern people in the trametinib group experienced more serious side effects than people in the standard of care group the most common serious side effects seen with trametinib included skin rash low red blood cell counts anemia high blood pressure and diarrhea these side effects are treatable but could also require some patients to reduce the dose or stop taking the drug dr annunziata said there are a wide range of side effects that can be seen so oncologists need to be aware of these and closely monitor their patients who are on the drug dr matulonis cautioned participants in the trial also answered standard questionnaires to assess their quality of life at several points during treatment although people taking trametinib reported a worse quality of life at months after starting treatment there was no difference in quality of life between the groups in assessments at later timepoints dr gershenson said trametinib should be seriously considered when a patient s cancer first comes back he continued however because of the drug s potential side effects it may not always be the go to treatment for instance he explained for some patients it may be better to start with something like the hormone therapy letrozole because the side effects are much better tolerated ultimately dr gershenson said patients and their physicians will need to weigh the potential harms and benefits of trametinib against those of other treatment options although experts agree that trametinib should be considered a new standard of care for patients with recurrent low grade serous ovarian cancer novartis the company that makes the drug and contributed study funding said it currently has no plans to seek food and drug administration approval for this particular use however after the study results were presented at a conference trametinib was put on the national comprehensive cancer network compendium of drugs for low grade serous ovarian cancer and that has allowed most people who might benefit from the drug to get insurance coverage at least in the united states dr gershenson said some important questions still need to be answered about how best to use trametinib dr annunziata said they include whether trametinib should be given only after someone has received chemotherapy or hormone therapy or as their initial treatment as well as whether the drug should be given alone or with other treatments our study will undoubtedly lead to other trials testing combinations of a mek inhibitor and other drugs including hormone therapy dr gershenson said we need to accelerate our efforts toward the discovery of additional novel drugs or regimens including options with fewer serious side effects he and his colleagues are also doing additional experiments to identify biomarkers that can best predict which patients with low grade serous ovarian cancer are most likely to benefit from drugs that target mek older post telehealth based cancer care surged

staff appointments with health care providers via video and phone calls known as telehealth increased dramatically during the covid pandemic credit istock after their year old daughter eva was diagnosed with advanced wilms tumor in chris and alicia labonne sought out a second opinion on eva s treatment from doctors at vanderbilt ingram cancer center vicc in nashville but instead of making the two and a half hour drive from their home in chattanooga to nashville for an office visit the labonne family hopped on a video call with a pediatric oncologist at vicc when your child is going through cancer just those little things like you get to stay home one more day instead of having to go to the hospital again can make a big difference alicia said doing the visit virtually just made it so much easier on the whole family during the video call the vicc oncologist reviewed eva s medical records shared his knowledge of eva s specific type of tumor and discussed treatment options to give her the best possible outcome all from a laptop set up on the labonne family s kitchen table chris only had to take minutes off from teleworking instead of an entire day traveling to nashville that telehealth visit went so well that chris and alicia decided to transfer eva s care to vicc the family then met with a pediatric surgeon to discuss eva s surgery plan and a radiation oncologist to coordinate her radiation schedule those visits were also done by telehealth in december eva began her treatments in person at vicc if we could have done chemo over telehealth we would have alicia joked by july a scan showed that eva s cancer was gone for families like the labonnes the option to see health care providers virtually is reshaping their cancer care experience although it can t entirely replace in person care telehealth offers patients convenience time and cost savings flexible scheduling access to specialists far away and what many patients and doctors describe as intangible benefits such as reduced exposure to germs oncology is not a unique example of telehealth s growth from primary care to cardiology as the use of telehealth surged during the covid pandemic so too has the demand for more access to this virtual form of health care but experts caution that our understanding of the role of telehealth in cancer care and how to deliver it equitably is still in its infancy studies are needed they say to help telehealth transition successfully from a temporary solution during the pandemic to a permanent and integral part of the cancer care experience that s accessible to all who need it virtual cancer care visits catch on telehealth sometimes referred to as telemedicine is health care provided by doctors and other health care providers from a distance using electronic means telehealth visits are typically done by phone or video and can also include email and text message exchanges between a patient and their providers in some cases telehealth may be complemented by remote monitoring of patients with data on their symptoms being collected electronically using devices such as wearable activity trackers the development of telehealth as it s conducted today can be traced to the s when nasa developed technology to monitor the health of astronauts while they were in space although telehealth eventually found its way into mainstream clinical practice the covid pandemic led to its widespread adoption in nearly every aspect of patient care kevin m curtis m d medical director of the center for telehealth at dartmouth hitchcock health said that before the pandemic this academic medical center was averaging eight scheduled outpatient telehealth visits a day when the pandemic first peaked in april the number of telehealth visits swelled to more than in a single day although adoption of telehealth at dartmouth hitchcock s norris cotton cancer center was initially slower than it was with some other specialties it has been growing steadily said anna tosteson sc d of norris cotton who has been studying patterns of telehealth use at the cancer center along with dr curtis our experience over the pandemic highlighted the potential for telehealth to be a game changer with regard to timely access to care dr tosteson noted more recently probably somewhere in the ballpark of about of outpatient oncology visits are done by telehealth dr curtis explained compared with virtually none before the pandemic the cancer center s slower adoption of telehealth initially he added may have at least partially been caused by limitations in the telehealth platform which have since been upgraded other nci designated cancer centers have also seen a rise in telehealth use during the pandemic in august of patient visits at the university of texas at san antonio mays cancer center were occurring by telehealth at the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at jefferson health in philadelphia nearly patients were seen via telehealth between march and july compared with approximately patients during the same period in the telehealth surge has been partly aided by temporary policy measures have helped loosen some of the restrictions around telehealth during the public health emergency such as those preventing health care providers from providing remote care across state lines many states also waived licensure requirements for clinicians to provide telehealth now legislation is working its way through congress to help make some of these changes permanent the telehealth extension act for example aims to lift geographic restrictions to allow people with medicare to access telehealth no matter where they live dr curtis said it will be important to see what results from some of these legislative efforts as well as policies around insurance reimbursement and licensure because those variables could impact hospitals doctor s offices willingness to fully invest long term in telehealth in the meantime it s important for the health care community to continue accumulating evidence showing that telehealth provides value to both patients and clinicians he said telehealth delivers high satisfaction while these bills move through the legislation labyrinth many people with cancer have reported high satisfaction with their telehealth visits according to available data that appears to be particularly true for certain needs such as cancer genetic counseling larry starling s treatment for male breast cancer at a local hospital is being guided via telehealth by an oncologist at vicc contrary to the perception that patients may feel disconnected to their health care providers in a virtual setting starling said his telehealth visits have felt more personal than his in person office visits in an office setting the doctor is thinking about the next patient he said whereas on the telehealth visit you feel like it s just you and the doctor and you have their undivided attention after he was diagnosed with male breast cancer larry starling often met with his oncologist via telehealth credit larry starling starling said that his vicc oncologist shares his screen virtually so they can look at his scans together the technology is to the point where you almost feel like you re in the office with him he said i didn t lose any feeling of being connected talking to him over the telehealth visit clinicians have generally reported high satisfaction with telehealth in a survey of approximately oncologists conducted in the spring of the majority were satisfied with telehealth and wanted to continue using it in fact nearly of those surveyed believed video visits were sufficient for managing most aspects of patient care including discussing treatment plans and reviewing laboratory results however the majority felt that in person visits were preferable for promoting a strong physician patient connection in addition they felt that certain kinds of conversations such as new diagnoses and end of life discussions were better handled in person there are some things we can t do via telehealth said debra l friedman m d associate director for community science and health outcomes at vicc who was not involved in the survey there s no way to do mammography there s no way to do a colonoscopy there s no way to do a low dose ct scan for lung cancer screening addressing health disparities amid the increasing demand for telehealth experts worry that some populations that could potentially benefit the most from telehealth including older adults and those living in rural areas may be left behind others include people from low income groups and racial ethnic minority groups and those for whom english is not their first language telehealth has the potential to address disparities because marginalized populations can struggle disproportionately with issues like transportation barriers time away from work and competing demands for caregiving telehealth can really ameliorate a lot of those demands said urmimala sarkar m d associate director of the university of california san francisco s center for vulnerable populations in practice though certain obstacles are preventing telehealth from being a realistic possibility for many people dr sarkar added issues like the lack of high speed internet language barriers and lack of comfort with the technology used to conduct telehealth visits can be insurmountable for many patients what we see is that there s a difference between that theoretical potential to reduce disparities and the way that telehealth actually functions she noted i worry that instead of addressing a disparity we re creating a disparity said dr friedman because what we have found is that the patients who are most likely to use telehealth were the patients who were actually the most served it was not ethnic and racial minorities and it was not patients who were of low socioeconomic status those struggled with telehealth researchers at the university of kansas cancer center looked at medicare claims data from people newly diagnosed with cancer to identify patterns of telemedicine use nearly of patients with the highest socioeconomic status had a telemedicine visit within days of their cancer diagnosis they found compared with less than half of patients in lower socioeconomic groups the patients in the highest socioeconomic groups continued to have high rates of telemedicine use in subsequent months while rates among those in the lowest socioeconomic groups remained low matthew b mackwood m d m p h of dartmouth hitchcock health who is studying factors influencing telemedicine use among rural populations pointed out that the ability to use a telephone is far more universally accessible to individuals than telehealth visits using video calls as the pandemic has slowed down there have been proposals to cut or restrict health insurance coverage of phone based telehealth visits if those changes are made dr mackwood said it may exacerbate some of the existing disparities in cancer care in our cancer center something like of the telehealth visits are done via telephone rather than video he noted dr friedman and her colleagues are conducting a clinical trial called encore to determine whether supporting doctors and patients in rural hospitals by giving them access to expertise and supportive care from oncologists at vicc via telehealth will enhance cancer care she pointed out that doctors currently use a variety of videoconferencing systems including zoom webex and platforms integrated into patients electronic health records and that the mix of platforms can be confusing for people who are less comfortable with technology what we re doing in the encore study is collecting data about what works and doesn t work dr friedman said i think we have to have simpler platforms and i think we re always going to need some human support from telehealth to teleresearch cancer clinical trials have also had to adapt to restrictions imposed by the pandemic for example some aspects of clinical trials are now being performed virtually particularly for trials that focus on cancer prevention and survivorship explained ann geiger ph d m p h of the nci community oncology research program ncorp providing patients with information about a clinical trial so they can decide whether they d like to participate is probably one of the easiest things to do virtually dr geiger said other clinical trial activities that have converted to a virtual setting include completing quality of life questionnaires clinical follow up visits pain management consultations and behavioral treatment for smoking cessation one question is whether telehealth will help streamline how clinical trials are conducted for example by enabling faster patient accrual i don t think we know the answer yet said dr geiger it s such a complicated situation my hope certainly is that if you reduce the burden on patients so instead of having to come in monthly you re coming in quarterly people might be more willing to be in a trial but we shall see looking ahead in telehealth beyond telehealth visits by phone and video another component of telehealth where interest is surging is remote monitoring of patients symptoms via mobile phone and other devices in a study led by researchers from huntsman cancer institute at the university of utah patients used a remote monitoring system to regularly report any cancer and treatment related symptoms they were experiencing at home patients who do report symptoms get guidance on how to best manage them including direct follow up for any symptoms that continue to bother them the remote monitoring has been a success not only were patients symptoms much improved but they were better able to manage them on their own at home than patients who didn t undergo remote monitoring future advances in remote monitoring may open up other possibilities as well such as being able to analyze blood samples at home said kathi mooney ph d r n the study s lead investigator that can be particularly helpful in oncology new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality are also helping to expand the limits of telehealth an ongoing nci study for example is looking into whether virtual reality technology delivered remotely can help reduce stress and improve mood in adults being treated for brain tumors participants view relaxing scenes using virtual reality goggles received in the mail and complete a questionnaire about their symptoms telehealth s role in cancer care will continue to evolve dr friedman said but experts agree that it will involve a hybrid of telehealth and in person care telehealth is here to stay dr friedman said we just have to continue to work on making it more available and simpler for people to use alicia labonne is grateful that telehealth was a part of her daughter s journey to recovery telehealth is such a big asset right now she said i hope that it continues for families just like ours nci funds research on telehealth in cancer care delivery the adoption of telehealth has skyrocketed but these actions have been based on necessity and not science said roxanne jensen ph d of the healthcare delivery research program in nci s division of cancer control and population sciences dccps there s still a lot of innovation needed to figure out how telehealth can be uniquely adapted to focus on cancer care services like screening and remote monitoring to improve quality of care and health outcomes to help answer some of the key questions about delivering cancer care via telehealth nci is launching a program called trace telehealth research centers of excellence starting in summer the program will fund three centers of excellence to conduct research focused on ensuring equitable access and delivery of telehealth based cancer care dccps has also released a notice of special interest on the topic of telehealth in cancer care to solicit applications for research on the use of telehealth in cancer related care robin c vanderpool dr p h of dccps s behavioral research program said that recent studies on telehealth in cancer care have been more quantitative looking at how many people are using telehealth and who is most likely to use it she hopes this new funding from nci will incentivize more research on telehealth s impact on patient outcomes patient provider communication and health care use in addition dccps has launched a webinar series telehealth and cancer studying its role in cancer control and care delivery that

nci staff survivors of childhood cancer aren t any less likely to have healthy babies in adulthood a new study shows credit istock first the good news survivors of childhood cancer who became pregnant in adulthood are as likely to have healthy babies as those without a history of cancer according to a new study their children also didn t have higher risks of birth defects or other health problems at birth however the study does suggest that these women face other pregnancy risks that may warrant more intensive obstetric care for example women who had been treated for cancer as children had higher risks of several severe complications during pregnancy delivery and the period after delivery the results were published january in the journal of the national cancer institute the message here is largely positive said study leader paul nathan m d of the hospital for sick children in toronto canada women who have a history of childhood cancer have a really good chance of getting pregnant and most of them are quite fine through the pregnancy but it s super important for the people caring for them to know about these risks in the united states many health care providers may not know if a patient was treated for cancer as a child especially if they ve moved between medical systems cities or states explained emily tonorezos m d director of nci s office of cancer survivorship who was not involved with the new study high risk obstetric care is widely available in most of the country but childhood cancer survivors may not be recognized as needing that kind of care she said beyond fertility to pregnancy major progress has been made in treating many childhood cancers over the last several decades today about of children diagnosed with cancer will live for or more years compared with about in the s many of these cancers will never return these successes have allowed researchers to turn some of their focus to making treatments less toxic and improving the quality of life for survivors of childhood cancer as they grow up when you talk with adolescents and young adults about their big post cancer concerns fertility is very high on that list said dr nathan cancer treatments can potentially affect future fertility for both women and men for example radiation therapy to or near the abdomen pelvis or spine can harm nearby reproductive organs radiation therapy to the brain can also damage the pituitary gland which helps control the production of certain hormones needed for pregnancy some types of chemotherapy can affect the ovaries causing them to stop releasing eggs and estrogen having been treated for cancer during childhood can also affect sexual health body image and financial stability during childbearing years many studies have focused on fertility preservation with promising results women and girls now have several options that can help preserve their fertility including freezing embryos or eggs and new technology holds promise for boys undergoing cancer treatment before they re old enough to freeze sperm fewer studies to date have focused on what happens during pregnancy for survivors of childhood cancer despite the shortage of data international guidelines were recently published to help doctors counsel their patients who are survivors about any specific pregnancy related issues explained dr tonorezos the guidelines were an important first step she continued but more research to better understand the risks during pregnancy for childhood cancer survivors is urgently needed she said i think there are some lingering fears among survivors about pregnancy after cancer mostly safe some risks for women for their study dr nathan and his colleagues examined data captured by the single payer health insurance program covering ontario canada they identified about women who had been treated for cancer between and before the age of the team matched each of the women to five other women who weren t treated for cancer before age by age and postal code and then compared reported pregnancies between the two groups they also compared the risks of miscarriage past weeks into pregnancy as well as the risks of more than other health problems for both mothers and children the researchers found that cancer survivors were just as likely to carry their pregnancy past weeks however about of babies born to survivors were preterm defined as birth before week of pregnancy compared with around of babies born to women who had not been treated for cancer there was no difference in birth defects or apgar scores a screening test used at birth to determine the baby s need for additional medical services between babies born to cancer survivors and the women in the control group survivors didn t have higher risks of preeclampsia gestational diabetes or caesarean delivery however they were at higher risk for several other complications including heart problems and severe complications during or after birth several aspects of patients medical or treatment history were associated with specific pregnancy complications overall by age the survivors were somewhat less likely than women not treated before the age of to have been pregnant about of cancer survivors in the study had a recorded pregnancy compared with about of women not treated for a childhood cancer the databases used in the study did not collect information on whether women were unable to conceive however other studies have also shown fewer pregnancies among cancer survivors wrote hazel nichols ph d of the university of north carolina and daniel green m d of st jude children s research hospital in an accompanying editorial such trends indicate that to fully support cancer survivors it is also essential to consider the indirect consequences of an early cancer diagnosis including disruptions to relationships impacts on sexual health and the potential for financial hardship as additional challenges to parenting goals they wrote recognizing the need for high risk obstetric care overall the number of serious complications were fairly small only out of more than survivors about experienced either a severe complication during labor or developed a heart problem during pregnancy however cancer survivors were twice as likely to experience either issue as women not treated for cancer and the potential impacts of these complications can be severe women who were treated for cancer before the age of would benefit from discussions with their doctors about whether they need a referral for high risk obstetric care said dr nathan such care can include monitoring a woman s heart throughout pregnancy as well as frequent fetal monitoring most pregnant survivors are seen by family doctors or obstetricians who may know nothing about their cancer history or these specific risks dr nathan said figuring out how to share this information with health care providers is going to be one of our key goals he added health care providers knowledge of a patient s cancer history can also spur other important conversations about reproductive health for example some women go through menopause early after taking certain chemotherapy drugs dr nathan said that can shrink their window for conceiving or pursuing fertility preservation techniques compared with women who haven t been treated for cancer the burden of making sure you re getting good health care is very often on the survivor and their family said dr tonorezos that s not where the burden should be but survivors need to make sure health care providers have some of that information because sharing data is not built into our health system she added future research that would be helpful to survivors hoping to become pregnant could include testing which prenatal care strategies provide the most benefits in terms of preventing dangerous complications dr tonorezos said but overall these results are encouraging she said the expectation of a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby should be the norm even for childhood cancer survivors she said older post experimental medulloblastoma treatment gets a boost with nanoparticles newer post telehealth based cancer care surged during covid will

by nci staff the nanoparticle is made of a flexible polymer blue that assembles into tiny soap bubble like shapes with the drug red cradled in the center credit marina sokolsky papkov unc chapel hill a new study in mice has shown that loading the cancer drug palbociclib ibrance in nanoparticles can boost its ability to fight medulloblastoma a type of brain cancer the nanoparticle coating helps the drug reach tumors better and stay in the body longer according to the researchers who led the study medulloblastoma is a rare aggressive brain cancer that affects children and young adults while most patients are cured with surgery radiation and chemotherapy they are typically left with debilitating side effects and for the in people whose cancer comes back after initial therapy there are no highly effective treatment options so although standard medulloblastoma therapy is effective for most patients it s still not really satisfactory with disabling toxicity and too many failures said pediatric neuro oncologist timothy gershon m d ph d of the university of north carolina unc lineberger comprehensive cancer center in chapel hill one of the study s lead researchers the study showed that palbociclib on its own didn t shrink medulloblastoma tumors in mice and the mice died quickly when the researchers treated mice with palbociclib loaded in nanoparticles the mice lived longer but their tumors eventually grew back however mice treated with nanoparticles containing both palbociclib and another drug sapanisertib lived substantially longer than those treated with either drug alone results of the study partially funded by nci were published january in science advances one of the challenges of treating medulloblastoma is drug penetration into tumors and it does seem like this nanoparticle formulation makes the drug better at precisely that entering the brain and getting into tumors said marta penas prado m d of nci s center for cancer research dr penas prado who cares for adult patients with medulloblastoma was not involved in the study given these promising results from the mouse study we are brainstorming ways to bring this approach to clinical trials said the study s other lead researcher marina sokolsky papkov ph d of unc chapel hill shortcomings of palbociclib palbociclib is a targeted therapy that blocks a pair of proteins cdk and cdk that act abnormally in some tumors driving them to grow out of control it is currently used as a breast cancer treatment and is being studied as a treatment for other cancers with abnormal cdk and cdk activity including medulloblastoma for their study the researchers used mice that were genetically engineered to develop medulloblastoma tumors a few days after birth without any treatment these mice survived just a few days after developing tumors treating the mice with palbociclib didn t help the mice live any longer the researchers found that s because the drug doesn t get into the brain easily explained dr sokolsky papkov in such cases she said the traditional approach is let s try a higher dose to get a bit more into the brain but everything that s not getting into the brain is ending up somewhere else in the body and creating toxicity instead the team designed a nanoparticle that they hoped would help palbociclib reach tumors in the brain and make it less toxic to the rest of the body to create the nanoparticle they used a flexible polymer that assembles into tiny soap bubble like shapes called micelles that cradle the drug in the center once inside the body the nanoparticles slowly release the encapsulated drugs our polymer is unique in the way that it can hold a lot of the drug inside said dr sokolsky papkov whose research focuses on nanotechnology based drug delivery systems also it has the capability to hold several drugs in the same micelle nanoparticles help palbociclib reach brain tumors the team s nanoparticle appeared to hit the nail on the head the peak concentration of the palbociclib nanoparticle in mouse tumors was higher than that of regular palbociclib the nanoparticle form also stayed in the bloodstream longer compared with regular palbociclib the same dose of the palbociclib nanoparticle was less toxic to the mice the highest dose of the palbociclib nanoparticle that the mice were able to tolerate was times that of regular palbociclib the scientists found that s likely because the nanoparticle coating prevents palbociclib from harming the abdominal organs the drug is in the nanoparticle and not interacting with parts of the body we don t want it to like the kidneys and liver dr gershon explained the palbociclib nanoparticle was also effective against the cancer the nanoparticle slowed the growth of medulloblastoma tumors and mice treated with the nanoparticle lived longer than those treated with regular palbociclib median survival of days versus days combination treatment sidesteps drug resistance although the palbociclib nanoparticle shrank medulloblastoma tumors in mice the effects didn t last long and the tumors began to grow again after a few days scientists call this phenomenon drug resistance when cancer cells grow readily despite the presence of a drug that once killed them drug resistance is a challenge that happens very often in the treatment of tumors dr penas prado said if you target one specific pathway tumors have ways to compensate for that by using other pathways to keep growing by looking at individual cancer cells the research team found that cells that were resistant to palbociclib nanoparticles had reduced activity of a protein called mtor the scientists reasoned that while lower mtor activity might help cancer cells resist palbociclib treatment they may be unable to survive if mtor activity is wiped out entirely so the team loaded nanoparticles with both palbociclib and sapanisertib an investigational drug that blocks mtor to see if further reducing the activity of this protein would shrink tumors for longer mice treated with the two drug nanoparticles lived substantially longer than those treated with nanoparticles containing either drug alone all of the mice treated with palbociclib nanoparticles or sapanisertib nanoparticles died within days but of the mice treated with the two drug nanoparticles lived for more than days these mice have a very aggressive form of medulloblastoma dr sokolsky papkov said so seeing a response like this where the mice are living so much longer this result is amazing looking toward clinical trials while the results are promising this approach has only been tested in mice so far dr penas prado cautioned whether the toxicity profile safety and efficacy of the nanoparticle are similar better or worse in humans remains to be proven she said before moving to studies in people the team needs to do more lab studies on the safety of their nanoparticle dr sokolsky papkov explained the polymer in the nanoparticle has not been approved for use in humans so they can t move ahead to clinical studies just yet she said but looking ahead dr gershon said they hope to test the palbociclib nanoparticle in a clinical trial specifically for people with recurrent medulloblastoma because they don t have good treatment options dr penas prado agreed adding that eventually it could also be tested as an adjuvant to up front therapy with the intention of decreasing the dose of radiation that patients need to receive that could potentially lessen the amount of damage radiation does to developing bodies she said even beyond that this nanoparticle approach has the potential to improve treatments for other kinds of brain cancer dr gershon noted the team plans to study the approach in a mouse model of glioblastoma he added older post why are many

enlarge cervical cancer screening has dramatically reduced new cases and deaths from the disease over the past years but the percentage of women in the united states who are overdue for cervical cancer screening has been growing and the reasons have not been clear to better understand the decline in cervical screening researchers analyzed data on more than women who were eligible for screening in the united states between and the analysis showed the rates of timely cervical cancer screening fell overall in addition the analysis showed disparities among groups of women in compared with non hispanic white women asian and hispanic women were more likely to be overdue for screening as were women who lived in rural areas lacked insurance or identified as lesbian gay bisexual queer other or unsure lgbq the most common reason study participants gave for not receiving timely screening was lack of knowledge about screening or not knowing they needed screening according to findings published in jama network open on january cervical cancer is preventable said lead investigator ryan suk ph d of the university of texas health science center in houston but the incidence of the disease is higher than it should be and there are large disparities in the rates of timely screening among women of different sociodemographic groups the new findings highlight how important it is for health care providers to recommend cervical cancer screenings to their patients dr suk continued awareness campaigns that use culturally appropriate messages are needed to promote cervical screening to groups with lower than optimal screening rates she added in addition the role of clinicians in contributing to improvements in cervical screening rates deserves further study according to the study authors the increase in the proportion of women who said they did not know screening was needed or that they did not have a recommendation from a health care provider is surprising and concerning said veronica chollette r n of nci s health systems and interventions research branch who was not involved in the research the marked decline in up to date screening for cervical cancer over time occurred even as new legislation was expanding access to effective screening tests for example the expansion of medicaid in many states and certain provisions of the affordable care act have increased coverage of recommended screenings as access to care continues to improve dr suk said recommendations from health professionals for their patients to get screened will likely become increasingly important for improving screening rates defining up to date screening for cervical cancer nearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by persistent infection with high risk types of human papillomavirus hpv for decades screening with the pap test cytology has allowed doctors to detect precancerous changes that could lead to cancer or the disease in its early stages when it is most treatable more recently hpv testing and hpv pap cotesting have become available for cervical cancer screening while previous studies have reported declines in up to date screening for cervical cancer dr suk and her colleagues wanted to assess patterns of cervical screening in the united states by sociodemographic groups and try to learn why many women were overdue for screening to do so they used data from the national health interview survey for and participants in the survey answered questions about various demographic health behavior and health care characteristics in a structured face to face interview the researchers defined being up to date on screening based on the us preventive services task force uspstf recommendations that were in effect in and in that meant screening women aged to with a pap test every years over time the uspstf recommendations evolved in and in up to date screening was defined as screening women aged to every years with a pap test alone and for women aged to screening every years with a pap test alone or every years with hpv testing or hpv pap cotesting changes to the guidelines during the study period may have caused confusion among patients and doctors about the timing and recommended intervals for screening according to the researchers results on cervical screening from the national health interview survey using the national health interview survey data the researchers found that the percentage of women overall who were not up to date on screening jumped from in to in when the findings were analyzed by race and ethnicity asian women were most likely to be overdue for screening in although the reasons for that aren t clear the incidence of cervical cancer among asian women is not as high as in other groups so these women might not think they re at high risk dr suk noted nonetheless she continued asian women still need to be screened for this potentially deadly cancer rates of overdue screening were also higher among women who identified as lgbq than among heterosexual women in versus the national health interview survey offers only two gender categories male or female so the researchers could not identify transgender individuals the inclusion of women identifying as lgbq in the study is particularly important said ms chollette the number of individuals identifying as lgbq is rising and reasons for their low cervical cancer screening rates are poorly understood and largely unexplored possible reasons for not being up to date on cervical screening the researchers also investigated potential reasons for the decrease in timely screening rates over time among the women who were not up to date on screening of women aged to years and of women aged to years said not knowing they needed screening was the reason for being overdue for screening not knowing they needed screening was the most common reason for being overdue across all groups ranging from of women identifying as lgbq to of women with hispanic ethnicity just of women aged to reported that receiving the hpv vaccine was the main reason for not being up to date on screening people who have been vaccinated against hpv still should be screened for cervical cancer because current vaccines do not protect against all hpv types that cause cervical cancer over time lack of access declined as a reason for being overdue for cervical screening the researchers noted from to the proportion of women aged to years who reported lack of access as a primary reason for not receiving screening decreased from to during this period in this population however lack of knowledge about screening as the primary reason increased from to as did not receiving recommendations from health care professionals from to the fact that not knowing that screening was needed increased over time as a reason for not being up to date on screening across most sociodemographic groups underscores the need to develop strategies to increase screening awareness for all women according to the study authors improving cervical cancer screening rates among diverse populations a limitation of the study was that participants could select only one response as the primary reason for not being up to date on cervical screening the study authors acknowledged many women including those who lack insurance those from racial and ethnic minority groups and those who identify as lgbq may experience multiple barriers to screening they noted the authors also cautioned that reducing the burden of cervical cancer will involve more than just improving timely cervical cancer screening rates another challenge is ensuring that women follow up with their health care providers after abnormal findings from cervical screening the pandemic has likely worsened the situation documented in the study ms chollette said once the pandemic hit screening for all cancers dropped off as many people delayed or cancelled their scheduled appointments future studies could focus on why current approaches for informing people about cervical screening e g electronic reminders from health care professionals chart reviews prior to appointments and posters in waiting rooms have failed to improve screening rates ms chollette said if a primary reason for the decline in cervical cancer screening is due to women not being aware that screening is needed she added then researchers need to explore why providers are not recommending cervical cancer screening primary care physicians need to keep track of screening schedules for multiple cancers dr suk acknowledged we need more effective and efficient tools and systems that help clinicians stay up to date on screening guidelines she continued we also need more research on the barriers that prevent clinicians from administering

cell blue attacking an infected cell green there are several types of t cells including naive t cells which have never encountered an antigen credit national institutes of health for some people with aggressive blood cancers such as certain types of leukemia a treatment called an allogeneic stem cell transplant can provide the most wished for outcome in cancer treatment a cure but sometimes the procedure results in a long term debilitating condition known as graft versus host disease gvhd gvhd occurs when immune cells from the donor that are given along with the stem cells during transplantation attack healthy tissues in the recipient s body along with the cancer cells a new study reports what may be a way to prevent chronic gvhd after a stem cell transplant by removing immune cells called naive t cells from the donated cells before they are transplanted the researchers found that this substantially reduced the risk of chronic gvhd among study participants without any apparent increase in their likelihood of relapse it s a strategy that seems to hit the sweet spot between preserving the delivery of beneficial immune cells and preventing chronic gvhd explained marie bleakley m d ph d of the fred hutchinson cancer research center who led the study in three small clinical trials only of patients who received a naive t cell depleted transplant developed chronic gvhd compared with more than of a group of similar patients who received a standard transplant at the same cancer center in the past of the cases of chronic gvhd that did develop in patients who got the experimental transplant none were severe results from the trials were published together january in the journal of clinical oncology the trials were all nonrandomized phase trials meaning that all participants received the experimental treatment dr bleakley and her colleagues are currently performing two randomized studies to confirm these early results randomized studies are needed before changes to the standard transplant regimen could be adopted explained steven pavletic m d of nci s center for cancer research but if we can do allogeneic transplants without patients suffering from chronic gvhd that s huge he said stem cell transplants the original cancer immunotherapy blood cancers arise from stem cells in bone marrow that produce the body s blood cells including the white blood cells needed to fight infections as part of treatment for some aggressive types of blood cancer people may receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant this procedure destroys the bone marrow where the stem cells reside with high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy then the patient gets an infusion of healthy stem cells from a donor often a family member matched to minimize the risks of transplant rejection and gvhd these stem cells travel to the bone marrow and over time provide the patient with all new blood cells in addition the immune cells infused along with the stem cells will hopefully recognize and kill any remaining cancer cells in the body a phenomenon called the graft versus leukemia effect allogeneic stem cell transplant is a form of cancer immunotherapy said dr pavletic it s been around for more than years but it s really the precursor of things like car t cell therapy that we have today t cells are among the many types of immune cells that can attack cancer cells but there are several subsets of t cells naive t cells have never encountered an antigen a protein or other molecule that can provoke an immune response for reasons that are not yet fully understood they are more likely to react to healthy cells in the transplant recipient if immune cells attack and damage those healthy tissues gvhd can result gvhd can develop within a few months of the transplant which is called acute gvhd the most commonly damaged organs in acute gvhd are the skin liver and intestines for some people acute gvhd can resolve with the use of immunosuppressive drugs gvhd that develops later and has certain distinct characteristics including specific changes to the skin mouth eyes and joints is considered chronic gvhd explained dr bleakley chronic gvhd is often a really serious condition and can last months to years said dr bleakley it s the primary cause of disability and chronic disease in stem cell transplant recipients she added in some people the condition can be fatal and if someone develops chronic gvhd they may need to be on drugs that suppress their immune system for many years immune suppressing drugs can have side effects and increase the person s risk of infection they can also cause problems if a cancer recurs explained dr bleakley people generally can t receive immunotherapies like car t cells while on these drugs but they can t stop taking them without the risk of their gvhd worsening then we re in a sort of catch position she said targeted t cell depletion getting rid of naive t cells only researchers had previously tried removing all t cells from donated cells before transplantation a strategy called t cell depletion but not all t cells are created equal without memory t cells for example which have prior exposure to and can remember specific pathogens many people developed severe or fatal infections after their transplants the idea to remove only naive t cells emerged almost two decades ago explained warren shlomchik m d director of hematopoietic stem cell transplant and cell therapy at the upmc hillman cancer center in pittsburgh the study s senior investigator at the time while working at yale university dr shlomchik and his colleagues looked at the difference between the contribution of naive and memory t cells to ghvd when we realized that memory cells caused less gvhd we saw the opportunity to translate that finding from the bench to the bedside he said to pull specific types of t cells out of donor grafts they adapted a laboratory technique for separating cells that uses antibodies joined to microscopic iron beads the antibodies are engineered to bind to proteins found only on specific types of t cells the donor blood is then passed by a magnet which latches on to the iron beads removing only the unwanted t cells from the graft his team quickly saw the potential for the technique to be used in the clinic in they joined nci s developmental therapeutics program rapid access to intervention development raid program which was designed to translate ideas from basic research into testable treatments they then partnered with fred hutchinson which has one of the largest stem cell transplant programs in the united states and brought a biotechnology company partner on board to manufacture a product needed for the selective t cell depletion method over the next decade the clinical team at fred hutchinson tested the strategy in three early phase trials they started out using high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy before transplantation known as the conditioning regimen which limited participation to younger healthier people over time the researchers found that less intensive conditioning regimens could also be used this allowed the team to increase the upper age limit for participation from to years old for the third trial between and people with acute leukemia received the naive t cell depleted transplants all participants also received the standard drugs given immediately after transplantation to prevent gvhd by the time the results were published surviving study participants had been followed for a median of years going head to head against the standard of care almost three quarters of the participants developed mild acute gvhd mostly affecting the upper gastrointestinal tract participants who developed acute gvhd were less likely to have their cancer return or to die which dr bleakley attributed to the graft versus leukemia effect of the of participants who developed chronic gvhd in nearly all cases the symptoms were mild and none were severe by comparison between and of people who previously received standard stem cell transplants at fred hutchinson developed chronic gvhd slightly more than of participants who received the naive t cell depleted transplants had a relapse of their cancer similar to what has been seen in historical comparison groups this and similar odds of survival compared with people who had received standard transplants suggests that the graft versus leukemia effect was not compromised by removal of the naive t cells dr bleakley explained two small randomized trials one in adults and one in children are now directly comparing rates of chronic gvhd in people randomly assigned to receive one of three types of transplants naive t cell depleted transplants standard transplants or a type of transplant that has come into wider use recently patients receiving this last type will get the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide immediately after transplantation which can suppress t cells likely to attack the recipient s tissues in addition to the goal of lowering rates of chronic gvhd with naive t cell depleted transplants we also want high survival rates and low relapse rates she continued is what we ve developed really better than the standard of care we think so but we can t know until we actually do the randomized trials the ongoing trials will also determine whether this method for depleting naive t cells can be replicated at other hospitals the initial experience in the pediatric trial showing feasibility in replication of the technique have been encouraging dr bleakley explained we ve trained half a dozen other centers and they re getting really nice results for the naive t cell depletion so far she said if the results from the ongoing trials turn out as hoped the new technique will also need to be tested in older adults said dr pavletic all participants in the ongoing randomized trials are aged or younger but about of blood cancers occur in patients older than he explained currently stem cell transplants are rarely used in people over age he added the fred hutchinson team had begun testing a combination of the less intensive conditioning regimens used for older patients and naive t cell depletion as part of the recently published study dr bleakley said when she and her colleagues first began these trials she explained they weren t sure whether intensive conditioning regimens were a prerequisite for transplants to work that is take up residence in the bone marrow and begin making healthy blood cells known as engraftment but in the last trial we had half the patients receive a less intensive conditioning regimen and their engraftment was just fine so we think we can back off the intensity even further she

by nci staff enlarge results from the topaz trial found the immunotherapy drug durvalumab modestly improved survival in people with biliary tract cancer credit national cancer institute new results from a large clinical trial offer a glimmer of hope for people with biliary tract cancer a rare but aggressive form of cancer which can include bile duct cancer or gallbladder cancer the study called topaz found that adding the immunotherapy drug durvalumab imfinzi to standard chemotherapy modestly extended how long people with advanced biliary tract cancer lived topaz is the first large clinical trial to show that initial or first line treatment that includes immunotherapy can improve survival in patients with advanced biliary cancer even a small improvement in survival is noteworthy experts said because the outlook for people with this fast growing type of cancer is poor and treatment options are limited in the trial adding durvalumab to chemotherapy extended the length of time that people were still alive after starting treatment by a median of about weeks compared with people who received chemotherapy plus a placebo at years after starting treatment on the trial roughly of patients who received chemotherapy plus durvalumab were still alive compared with of patients who received chemotherapy plus a placebo topaz study leader do youn oh m d ph d of seoul national university hospital in south korea presented the findings january at the american society of clinical oncology gastrointestinal cancers symposium the study has the potential to change the standard of care for people with advanced biliary tract cancer said nilofer saba azad m d an oncologist at johns hopkins university s sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center who spoke at the symposium about the trial but was not involved in it from one perspective the modest improvement in patient survival provided by adding durvalumab is disappointing said tim greten m d head of the gastrointestinal malignancy section in nci s center for cancer research but there is a bigger picture dr greten continued i m enthusiastic because this study shows actual benefit to patients and is the first to show that immunotherapy might work in people with this difficult to treat cancer a new treatment that extends survival is something we haven t seen in this cancer type for many years dr greten said however he said the modest survival benefit tells me that a lot more work needs to be done durvalumab improved survival without causing additional serious side effects biliary tract cancer which includes cancer of the bile ducts and gallbladder is rare with an estimated new cases diagnosed in the united states in but the number of new cases being diagnosed worldwide each year is increasing said dr oh surgery to remove the entire tumor offers the only chance of a cure for biliary tract cancer but these cancers are often diagnosed when the disease is at an advanced stage and surgery is no longer an option for more than a decade the chemotherapy combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has remained the standard first line treatment for people with advanced biliary tract cancer including cancer that comes back after initial treatment however the biological features of biliary tract cancer suggested that it might be responsive to immunotherapy at least in some cases dr azad said in a smaller preliminary clinical trial dr oh and her colleagues found that adding durvalumab to the standard gemcitabine cisplatin combination showed promising antitumor activity as a first line treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer those results were the basis for conducting a larger trial topaz which was funded by astrazeneca the manufacturer of durvalumab enrolled people with inoperable advanced biliary tract cancer the trial was conducted in the united states and other countries and slightly more than half of participants were from asian countries dr oh said participants were randomly assigned to receive durvalumab plus gemcitabine cisplatin or a placebo plus gemcitabine cisplatin after a maximum of eight cycles of chemotherapy patients continued treatment with either durvalumab or a placebo respectively all treatments including the placebo were given intravenously a placebo was used so that neither patients nor investigators would know which treatment group patients were assigned to according to the findings presented at the meeting people who received durvalumab lived a median of months and those who received chemotherapy alone lived a median of months patients in the durvalumab group also survived longer without their disease getting worse than those in the chemotherapy only group a median of months versus months and were more likely to have their tumors shrink following treatment it is notable that the improvement to survival with durvalumab did not cause any new serious side effects dr oh said the most common side effects were a low red blood cell count anemia low white blood cell count neutropenia and nausea potentially serious treatment related side effects occurred in about two thirds of people in both treatment groups however few trial participants stopped treatment due to side effects and the number who did stop was similar in the two treatment groups she said which patients with biliary tract cancer are most likely to benefit topaz shows an enticing benefit of durvalumab when it comes to survival and tumor response rates but we do have some open questions dr azad said at the symposium one key question she and dr greten both noted is how to identify those people with biliary tract cancer who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy because cancers of the gallbladder and bile ducts are rare researchers always lump them together as biliary tract cancer in clinical trials even though their biology is different dr greten noted so it s possible that whether a patient s tumor responds to immunotherapy may depend on its location in the biliary tract in addition dr azad said recent studies show that biliary tract tumors can be divided into subgroups based on their genetic features and there s a chance that some of these subgroups may respond better to durvalumab or other types of immunotherapy the bottom line said dr greten is that more work is needed to identify better drug combinations that can further extend survival for people with these devastating cancers related resources what is bile duct cancer cholangiocarcinoma bile duct cancer treatment older post air is life the navajo nation s

patricia nez henderson m d m p h and scott leischow ph d a flyer developed as part of advocacy efforts in support of the navajo nation commercial tobacco ban credit black hills center for american indian health dr nez henderson of the black hills center for american indian health is president elect of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco dr leischow is executive director of clinical and translational science at arizona state university s college of health solutions in the first legislation introduced to the navajo nation council calling for a ban on the use of all commercial tobacco products in all public buildings and businesses in the navajo nation proclaimed the navajo nation hereby finds use of commercial tobacco to be harmful to the sacred elements of air and earth use of commercial tobacco disrespects the navajo fundamental traditions use of commercial tobacco abuses our people and harms our environment resulting in disharmony with the body and the earth air embodies life this past fall following more than a decade of additional legislative proposals research collaboration and outreach the ban became a reality on november the navajo nation enacted the ni ch bee n air is life act of the first comprehensive ban on commercial tobacco products on american indian tribal lands the prohibition which went into effect on february and includes casinos other businesses and public navajo buildings and lands covers conventional cigarettes e cigarettes cigars and similar products it excludes tobacco used for ceremonial purposes and use of any tobacco product in a person s home as researchers who have spent much of our careers documenting the health and economic burdens of commercial tobacco and ways to mitigate those burdens it s difficult to overstate what this ban means for the health of the navajo people the din in navajo and its potential to inspire similar bans on other indigenous lands the story of how this landmark achievement came to be is quite remarkable because we can assure you it wasn t easy tobacco from indigenous people to commercial exploitation a good place to begin is with some history it s important to understand how essential tobacco is to navajo traditions and culture a form of tobacco known as dzi nat oh is a centerpiece of traditional navajo healing ceremonies as one navajo healer explained dzi nat oh is not used socially without purpose it s only used to heal a person s mind and body the tobacco traditionally used by healers which is grown and collected in its natural environment is a very different far purer product than the commercial tobacco that is grown on an industrial scale and then laced with chemicals to form more addictive and more lethal products many people don t know in fact that the word tobacco has indigenous roots unfortunately tobacco has also been an inseparable part of the colonization and exploitation that over centuries has decimated many indigenous communities in modern times the impact of this exploitation is reflected in the high rates of commercial tobacco use among american indian adults and youth it s also seen in the nearly inescapable exposure to secondhand smoke a documented cause of lung and other cancers as well as numerous other health problems among the workers at the casinos in the navajo nation and other tribal lands although there has been strong support for a ban on commercial tobacco products among the navajo people the largest american indian tribe at around or about of the american indian alaska native population a few key sticking points held up its advancement through the legislative process patricia nez henderson m d m p h among them were concerns that a ban would affect the use of tobacco for ceremonial purposes but perhaps the most difficult hurdle to overcome was anxiety fueled in part by tobacco industry propaganda about the potential financial impact of commercial tobacco free laws in navajo nation casinos casinos generate revenue and a lot of jobs for the navajo nation and other american indian tribes so it s no surprise that worries about a ban hurting the casinos were front and center in this debate research outreach advocacy the initial failure to pass a ban on commercial tobacco in was followed by another failure and then another those of us involved in research and advocacy agreed that it was time to rethink our efforts that included revisiting the type of research that was needed to better understand the navajo people s relationships with ceremonial and commercial tobacco and their perceptions of commercial tobacco free policies a major source of that information came as a result of nci funding of a large research project launched in networks among tribal organizations for clean air policies nato cap as might be expected the research supported by nato cap was not white lab coats and pipettes kind of work scott leischow ph d much of it involved talking with and collecting survey data from the navajo community healers tribal elders and other community leaders those interactions and survey results tended to center around the intersection of traditional navajo beliefs and commercial tobacco and how that knowledge is exchanged in order to make decisions an approach directly informed by nci tobacco control monograph which described a systems based approach to developing commercial tobacco control policies and practices conducted over the course of several years this research offered novel insights into how the din view and share information through their networks on commercial tobacco and commercial tobacco free policies including how such policies fit within traditional beliefs around clean air harmony with the environment and individual liberty it also provided a greater understanding of more pragmatic concerns about potential economic impacts on navajo businesses and the health impacts of secondhand smoke on their employees with regard to these latter issues we conducted investigations of how existing smokefree policies affected casinos we found for example that a smokefree policy enacted in illinois had no material economic impact on casinos there working with other groups we also gathered data on secondhand smoke in casinos those studies clearly showed that even with modernized ventilation systems exposure to particles from secondhand smoke was still dangerously high in the casinos better data on commercial tobacco bans strong advocacy and a pandemic what nato cap and other studies provided was a strong foundation that grassroots advocacy organizations including a group called team navajo could use to reinvigorate their efforts to get the commercial tobacco ban through the tribal council the navajo nation equivalent of the us congress formed in the early s team navajo has been a regular presence in the navajo nation serving as a conduit to educate the navajo community about research on commercial tobacco including the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and to advocate for policies banning commercial tobacco in the late s equipped with stronger information and data members of team navajo met with elders legislators and business leaders to educate them about the health benefits of a commercial tobacco ban and about the navajo community s support for such a ban at the same time they were able to allay concerns about any potential economic impact advocacy efforts also involved widespread public education on these topics often through radio newspaper ads and community meetings ironically it was the covid pandemic that provided the final opening needed to advance the ban in the legislature one of the chief concerns about a ban was its implementation how could it be rolled out in a way that would not be disruptive to businesses particularly casinos but with casinos shuttered for an extended period during the pandemic it became clear that the ban could be implemented while they were reopening greatly minimizing what potentially could be an otherwise difficult transition to a commercial tobacco free casino environment translating research into practice more tribes coming on board although most people probably don t associate the idea of translational science with something like a commercial tobacco ban this is an ideal example of it passing the ban required using knowledge gained from high quality research and making that knowledge available to networks of elected leaders advocates and others ultimately these efforts led to a change in policy that we know will save lives we also know that the impact of this policy change for the navajo nation has a potentially long wake in december for example the tribal council of the eastern band of cherokee indians in north carolina voted to ban smoking in the two casinos it runs on tribal lands smoking can still be permitted in small set away areas of course this was not the first commercial tobacco ban on tribal lands several other tribes have enacted similar bans although they either excluded casinos and or didn t cover additional products like e cigarettes and cigars now however there is clearly momentum toward more comprehensive commercial tobacco bans finally as is the case with most achievements of this scope it could never have happened without strong collaborations that includes the collaborative research supported by nato cap but it also includes the numerous local regional and national partners who helped push for this change whether that was sending letters of support for a ban to the tribal council providing economic data or helping with legislative language air is life and thanks to the efforts of so many we believe this ban will improve the lives of the proud people of the navajo nation older

by nci staff enlarge nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld which occurs when fat builds up in the liver steatosis can lead to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash a more serious liver condition characterized by inflammation and scar tissue credit adapted from plos one april doi journal pone cc by while new cases of most cancer types have dropped over the past decade cases of the most common type of liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma hcc are on the rise until recently the main cause of hcc was hepatitis c virus infection although hepatitis c infection still causes many cases of hcc the biggest contributor to the recent rise in cases is a condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash which can progress to hcc in a new nci funded study researchers have now identified a protein that could potentially be targeted to prevent both nash and liver cancer spectrin mice genetically modified to have no spectrin in their livers did not develop nash and when the same mice were injected with chemicals that cause liver cancer they developed fewer tumors than normal mice shuyun rao ph d of george washington university and her colleagues reported december in science translational medicine the researchers also showed that they could treat normal mice with rna molecules to reduce the amount of spectrin in their livers the rna treatment prevented nash in mice with healthy livers and reversed it in mice that had already developed the disease nash arises from a milder liver condition nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld it s estimated that approximately of adults worldwide have nafld with rates varying by country so if a safe spectrin blocking drug could be developed for use in humans dr rao said it could impact a lot of people nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver cancer nafld is characterized by a buildup of fat in the liver while people with nafld are at higher risk for other health problems like cardiovascular disease they don t usually have severe liver problems initially nafld is simply an accumulation of fat granules in liver cells explained konstantin salnikow ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who was not involved in the study the condition can be controlled or even reversed with exercise and changes in a person s diet people with obesity are at higher risk for developing nafld obesity is very common a third of the world s population has it said lopa mishra m d the study s senior investigator and up to of people with severe obesity are thought to have nafld in some cases nafld progresses to a more severe condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or nash in people with nash a buildup of fat causes liver inflammation and fibrosis where scar tissue builds up in the liver in some cases nash can result in liver cirrhosis a more severe form of fibrosis and people with nash often develop hcc while it s unclear what causes the transition up to of people with nash go on to develop liver cancer said dr mishra previous research however has suggested that a protein called tgf may be involved in this progression studies have shown that tgf can suppress or promote the growth of many types of tumors depending on the context dr salnikow said for example tgf prevents normal cells from becoming cancerous but it promotes metastasis in cancer cells and tgf is known to promote fibrosis specifically it s really the severity of fibrosis that predicts whether people with nash will get cancer and tgf plays a big role in fibrosis dr mishra explained dr mishra s team decided to take a closer look at spectrin because it organizes other proteins in the cellular communication pathway orchestrated by tgf indeed an earlier study had found that cancer cells did not react to tgf activity as expected when spectrin was absent preventing fatty liver disease and liver cancer in mice to investigate whether spectrin promotes nafld or nash dr rao and her team compared the livers of mice genetically engineered to lack the protein in their liver cells with those of normal mice the genetically modified mice did not seem to have impaired liver function despite the lack of spectrin it was a big surprise said dr mishra because spectrin is found in almost all cells researchers expected that it was crucial to cellular function the researchers went on to feed the mice one of two diets known to cause nafld and nash either a high fat diet or a western diet the western diet has really been shown to reproduce human nash in mice dr mishra explained and has a different fat content a different carbohydrate content than the high fat diet while the western diet has a lower fat content than the high fat diet it has still been shown to cause nash when fed either of these disease causing diets mice that lacked spectrin in their livers did not develop nash whereas normal mice did the genetically modified mice also gained less weight and had less body fat losing spectrin from their livers prevented nash but did it prevent liver cancer as well to find out the researchers needed to change their methods even in normal mice hcc does not occur often enough to test whether removing spectrin might prevent the cancer explained dr mishra to speed up the appearance of cancer in the mice the researchers induced hcc with a chemical called den normal mice treated with den developed liver tumors even when fed a standard diet compared with normal mice when mice lacking spectrin in their livers were treated with den they had far fewer liver tumors and the tumors that did form were smaller on average the team was also able to prevent and treat nash in normal mice by targeting spectrin to do so they designed rna molecules known as small interfering rnas sirna that could reduce the amount of spectrin produced in cells mice treated with sirna and then fed a high fat diet gained less weight and had less body fat than mice that were untreated furthermore when mice that had already developed nash after being fed a western diet were treated with the sirna their disease improved as measured by lower fat and sugar levels in their blood to better assess whether their findings in mice might apply to humans the researchers then turned to a different nash model a mix of human liver cells immune cells and support cells in a d structure this d culture model dr salnikow explained more closely mimics a human liver than just liver cells in culture the d cultures treated with spectrin sirna had fewer of the characteristics typically seen in the liver of a person with nash including the activity of several genes than d cultures treated with a control treatment it wasn t possible for the researchers to tell whether cancer was prevented in this model since the d cultures don t form tumors bringing spectrin targeted drugs to the clinic a big question now is whether sirna therapy for nash could potentially be useful in humans an sirna drug is already approved by the food and drug administration to treat another form of liver disease called hepatic porphyria dr mishra noted so sirna treatment strategies for the liver have been shown to work she said but there are still many steps to take before an sirna drug like the one used in this study could be used to treat people with nafld or nash dr mishra acknowledged although the mice used in their study are looking absolutely fine she continued further safety studies are needed before human studies can be launched and while targeting spectrin with sirna protected mice from chemically induced cancer and also prevented and treated nafld in mice it remains to be seen whether such a drug would prevent hcc in people with nash dr rao and her colleagues wrote there are also open questions regarding the precise way that spectrin promotes nafld while dr mishra s team did identify some molecular mechanisms by which the protein drives fat accumulation in the liver the question remains how does spectrin actually turn on fatty liver disease asked dr mishra the research team is also interested in identifying the specific parts of the spectrin protein that are responsible for promoting nafld this information could potentially be used to develop a small molecule drug to block this activity of spectrin this study may also have an impact on scientists understanding of nafld and liver cancer as a whole according to dr salnikow this is the starting point of understanding the role of the tgf pathway in the transition from nash to liver cancer he said this is only the tip of the iceberg older post president s

subscribe february by john p williams m d enlarge the president s cancer panel identifies high priority issues that are impeding progress against cancer and develops recommendations for addressing those issues in a report submitted to the president the panel s new report closing gaps in cancer screening connecting people communities and systems to improve equity and access was released on february in this article the chair of the president s cancer panel john p williams m d f a c s describes key points of the report much progress has been made in the past years since the signing of the national cancer act of which included the establishment of the president s cancer panel nevertheless there remain significant opportunities to make improvements across the cancer spectrum perhaps none more pressing than in the realm of prevention and early detection the covid pandemic has had broad and widespread impacts on our health care system among the most concerning have been disruptions in cancer screening according to studies from nci and others postponed and canceled cancer screenings and delayed treatments will result in thousands of excess cancer related deaths in the years to come this figure highlights the ability of cancer screening to save lives and the need to correct the misperception that it is elective furthermore the pandemic may very well exacerbate long standing disparities in screening and cancer outcomes overall by race ethnicity geography income and insurance status underutilization and inequities in screening before during and beyond the pandemic is a problem that must be addressed for our report the president s cancer panel chose to shine a spotlight on cancer screening to develop our report we spent the last year meeting with stakeholders including patients patient advocates health care providers researchers public and private insurers and others these meetings reaffirmed the need for more effective and equitable implementation of cancer screening the report we presented to president biden identifies key gaps and barriers to cancer screening in the united states and provides evidenced based and actionable recommendations to help increase equitable access to appropriate cancer screening and follow up care for all americans identifying barriers to cancer screening and follow up care timely cancer screening and early detection of cancer can help save lives not only can early cancer detection prevent cancer deaths it may reduce the need for aggressive cancer therapies avoiding aggressive cancer treatment not only spares patients potential side effects that lower their quality of life it also spares patients and their families from what can be a significant financial burden there are evidence based guidelines for how who and when to screen for several common cancers although there are differences between some guidelines many people who are eligible for cancer screening are not screened when they should be if they are screened at all as we learned during our stakeholder meetings the barriers to screening and follow up care after screening include lack of knowledge of guidelines lack of provider recommendation fears or concerns about medical procedures difficulty navigating the health care system logistical challenges including lack of transportation and lack of access to medical services but perhaps the most important thing we learned from these meetings is there is an opportunity for stakeholders across the national cancer program to act now to ensure that everyone in the united states has access to and receives appropriate cancer screening in our report to the president we describe those opportunities and suggest ways to address them improving communications many factors influence whether individuals choose to get screened for cancer but understanding why and when they should get screened what their options are for screening and how they can access screening is critical to ensuring that people get the preventive care they need our latest report recommends that communications campaigns be developed to help all americans better understand when and how they should be screened for various cancers these campaigns should make it easy for people to find information relevant to them from sources they trust information about cancer screening should be communicated clearly in language that is easy to understand and that addresses common concerns and misconceptions most importantly communications campaigns should empower people to take action by clearly defining the steps they should take to get screened to achieve this goal we are recommending the expansion of national roundtables groups comprised of stakeholders from multiple sectors working together with a focus on cancer screening improving access connecting people with care too many people in the united states face barriers to medical care including cancer screening and appropriate medical follow up these access challenges can include language barriers lack of transportation or time to visit a doctor fears about medical procedures mistrust of the health care system lack of health insurance or lack of nearby medical facilities to address these barriers it is important for health care systems to meet people where they are to ensure they receive the support and care they need in our report we highlight two key areas that will help improve access to cancer screening community oriented outreach and expansion of self sampling to screen for cervical and colorectal cancers to improve community oriented outreach we believe that community health workers are well positioned to play an integral role in supporting cancer screening community health workers serve as key connectors within communities to help people navigate health care systems including providing culturally appropriate information to increase awareness and understanding of cancer risk and cancer screening options because they understand the communities they serve they are well positioned to cultivate relationships of trust between health care systems and individuals in the community community health workers can also help people overcome logistical barriers to medical care by connecting them with resources such as transportation and services providing dependent care we recommend the expansion and sustainable funding of community health worker programs so that they can meet their full potential and connect more people with cancer screening and follow up care a visit to the hospital or the doctor isn t always necessary for people to receive screening for some cancers during our stakeholder meetings it became clear that self sampling including at home testing can increase access to cancer screening for people who live far from medical facilities have competing demands on their time or are uncomfortable in medical settings currently there are two cancers that can be screened for using self collected samples stool based tests for colorectal cancer and hpv self sampling tests to screen for cervical cancer stool based tests for colorectal cancer are currently integrated into us colorectal cancer screening guidelines but hpv self sampling tests although already adopted in other countries have not yet been approved by the us food and drug administration fda our report recommends the expansion of stool based testing for colorectal cancer screening and that fda prioritize the review of hpv self sampling tests for cervical cancer expanding self sampling for cancer screening can further enable health care providers to meet people where they are and has the potential to reach more people who are eligible for cancer screening in the united states helping medical teams work more effectively providers play a critical role in patients decisions to get screened for cancer however many providers particularly in primary care are increasingly stretched thin with limited time available during appointments that s why we recommend that health care systems and medical offices set up systems and processes that allow all members of the medical team to work together to support cancer screening programs providers should collaborate with nurses medical assistants office staff and others to help ensure their patients get appropriate screenings this includes establishing processes and systems for these staff to collect family and personal health histories identify patients who are eligible for cancer screening or genetic risk assessment initiate conversations about screening and help coordinate recommended follow up care every person a patient encounters during their health care visit has the potential to support cancer screening through a team based approach to medical care patients will we believe have more opportunities to get access to the care they need we also considered issues for people who are at higher risk of cancer because of their family history or other factors for example some people have inherited mutations in specific genes that increase their risk of cancer such as mutations in brca genes that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer these people may benefit from earlier more frequent or enhanced cancer screening currently most people with mutations in such cancer susceptibility genes never know they have them or don t find out until after they are diagnosed with cancer that s why it s so important that those with a family history of cancer be informed about genetic testing for risk assessment our report recommends empowering providers to offer genetic testing with informed consent without the need for pretest counseling by a certified genetic counselor or medical geneticist for patients this could mean fewer trips to the doctor further reducing the burden of time and logistics the final recommendation in our report is focused on improvements in health information technology it this includes widespread integration of cancer screening guidelines and clinical decision support tools into technologies commonly used in the clinic including but not limited to electronic health records these improvements in health it will streamline provider visits and improve access to appropriate recommended care providers would be better equipped to deliver recommendations about appropriate cancer screening and follow up care after an abnormal screening test because computer systems can keep track of patient eligibility and provide clinical decision support when needed john p williams m d f a c s chair president s cancer panel meeting the challenge we believe that improving equity and access to cancer screening is a significant opportunity for the national cancer program we consider this report a call to action for all stakeholders health care providers health systems insurers community and patient advocacy organizations professional societies government agencies and individuals to work together to close gaps in cancer screening for all populations in the united states through this action we can continue to build on the progress of the past years and contribute to saving many

by nci staff hla proteins red purple yellow blue display peptides small circles from inside the cell to help immune cells find cancerous or infected cells credit frontiers in immunology feb https doi org fimmu cc by hundreds of thousands of people with cancer take immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab opdivo and pembrolizumab keytruda every year but for the majority of those people the medicines a type of immunotherapy don t work to treat their cancer now nci scientists think they ve found a specific form of a gene that may make immune checkpoint inhibitors less effective for some people the gene form known as hla a is found in to of the us population if the findings are confirmed in further studies doctors could use the gene as a marker to help decide if a patient should or shouldn t take an immune checkpoint inhibitor said the scientist who led the study mary carrington ph d of nci s center for cancer research that could spare many patients from getting treatments that don t work for them and that can cause harsh side effects dr carrington added but she cautioned we need more data before doctors would actually use that marker in the clinic in their analysis of data from thousands of patients the researchers found that people with hla a died sooner after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment than people with other forms of the hla a gene the study published december in lancet oncology showed that this pattern held true for different immune checkpoint inhibitors and different types of cancer including kidney bladder and skin cancer timothy chan m d ph d director of the cleveland clinic s center for immunotherapy and precision immuno oncology called the findings exciting the next step continued dr chan who was not involved in the study is to work out how a can be used most efficiently with other biomarkers that are currently used to predict how well checkpoint inhibitors will work different forms of hla genes hla a is a member of a set of genes including hla b and hla c that help the immune system find and destroy cells that are cancerous or infected with a virus or bacteria these hla genes make proteins called human leukocyte antigens hla which take bits and pieces of proteins from inside the cell and display them on the cell s surface if the cell is cancerous or infected the hla proteins display abnormal fragments that trigger immune cells to destroy that cell and any others displaying the same fragment across the human population there are thousands of different forms of these hla genes which we call alleles explained dr carrington who leads nci s hla immunogenetics research a for instance is one of more than alleles of hla a that natural variation in hla genes is in part what makes some people more susceptible than others to certain viral infections and autoimmune diseases because immune checkpoint inhibitors help immune cells find and attack cancer cells scientists have long suspected that variations in hla genes may influence how well these treatments work possible links between various hla alleles and immune checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness have been studied extensively but so far a is the only one that seems to work as a marker of treatment response for multiple types of cancer and different immune checkpoint inhibitors dr carrington noted people with a benefit less from immunotherapy the team first sifted through data from a group of more than people with types of advanced cancer who were treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor at memorial sloan kettering cancer center among various hla alleles hla a emerged as the strongest biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness people with a regardless of what kind of cancer they had died nearly times sooner after starting treatment than those with a different allele the researchers found when the researchers separated the data by cancer type a was linked with a shorter time to death for people with bladder brain glioma melanoma lung and kidney cancer however the impact of having a was greatest in people with kidney cancer among participants of four clinical studies who received an immune checkpoint inhibitor for kidney cancer those with a didn t live as long before their kidney cancer grew back or they died progression free survival compared with those who didn t have the allele confirming the findings in randomized clinical trials is very good evidence that a is a biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness dr chan noted dr carrington and her team also found that people with two copies of a died sooner than people with one copy of a plus a copy of a different hla a allele and times sooner respectively than people with no copies of a the researchers validated their findings in two independent groups of patients who had been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors patients with various types of cancer treated at the dana farber cancer institute and people with bladder cancer who had participated in an international clinical trial in both groups those with a died sooner after starting treatment than those without this form of the gene and times sooner respectively the link between a and immune checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness held true regardless of a person s age sex ancestry the type of immune checkpoint inhibitor they took and whether they got chemotherapy at the same time however the allele wasn t linked with the outcomes of other kinds of cancer treatment combining biomarkers for immunotherapy while data from multiple clinical trials consistently showed the association of hla a with less clinical benefit in patients treated with immunotherapy these results should be validated in a prospective clinical study noted james gulley m d ph d of nci s center for cancer research and a leader of the study testing for a specific hla allele can be fast and reliable the researchers noted it s done routinely to match donors and recipients for organ transplants and as a way to tell who might have life threatening allergic reactions to certain hiv and epilepsy treatments and hla genes are included in several genetic biomarker tests that are commonly given to people with cancer dr chan noted but dr carrington cautioned just because someone has a doesn t necessarily mean that they won t benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors in all of the data the researchers looked at there were some people with a for whom immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment worked it s when we look at the entire population of people with a that we see overall there s less benefit she said ultimately models that combine multiple biomarkers might better predict whether an immune checkpoint inhibitor is likely to work for an individual dr chan said that s where this field is headed he added immunity is complex and we know hla is one part of the story he said but many factors from the total number of mutations in the tumor tumor mutational burden to the microbes that live in the gut also influence how well immune checkpoint inhibitors work and it s clear that all these things work together dr chan explained in a recent study he and his colleagues built a model that takes into account a person s genetics biology age and tumor stage among other factors to predict whether checkpoint inhibitors are likely to work the combination model was more accurate than tumor mutational burden alone at predicting whether a checkpoint inhibitor would be effective the researchers found as for dr carrington her group is focused on understanding why immune checkpoint inhibitors don t work well for people with a they are currently sifting through several plausible explanations but none has surfaced as the winner yet we ve been ruling things out one after another she said but that s the exciting part of science she added figuring out a great unknown older post even if insured people with advanced cancer often face financial problems newer post president s

january by nci staff having health insurance doesn t necessarily shield people with advanced cancer from financial hardship a new study has found credit istock many people being treated for advanced cancer experience serious financial problems related to the cost of their care even if they have health insurance according to a new study the study enrolled patients with advanced colorectal cancer of whom all but had health insurance one year after joining the study nearly three quarters of the patients were facing financial problems financial hardship caused by cancer care is far more common than we had previously thought and having health insurance does not seem to protect patients from financial hardship said study leader veena shankaran m d of the fred hutchinson cancer research center some patients experience financial hardship soon after being diagnosed with advanced cancer she continued approximately of the patients in the study reported financial problems in the months after their diagnosis we need to address the issue of financial hardship as we would any other complication of cancer therapy dr shankaran added the new findings she noted could help researchers better understand the magnitude of the problem the swog cancer research network conducted the study using a nationally representative sample of patients their findings appeared in the journal of the national cancer institute on january the results suggest that having health insurance may no longer be sufficient to protect patients and families from financial hardship and its adverse effects on health wrote robin yabroff ph d of the american cancer society and her colleagues in an accompanying editorial the findings also underscore the need to develop strategies for protecting people with cancer from financial hardship also known as financial toxicity said dr shankaran rising out of pocket medical costs for patients with advanced cancer in the united states cancer is among the most expensive medical conditions to treat patients may receive multiple treatments such as surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy and immunotherapy patients with cancer and their families also have substantial nonmedical costs such as transportation to treatment centers and people undergoing treatment for cancer may miss work and lose income as a result some patients and their families may have to decide between paying for their cancer care and covering the costs of basic household needs such as food housing and utilities noted dr yabroff and her colleagues in the editorial there is growing evidence of financial problems among people with cancer the current study is among the first to focus on patients who are undergoing active treatment for advanced cancer and to be conducted prospectively that is by collecting financial information from patients over time beginning soon after their diagnosis the researchers focused on advanced colorectal cancer in part because the chronic and intensive nature of treatment for the disease may have led to increased financial burdens among patients this study complements other research on cancer related financial hardship said janet de moor ph d of nci s healthcare delivery research program in the division of cancer control and population sciences who was not involved in the research the strengths of the study she added included its prospective design the geographic diversity of the study participants and the focus on recently diagnosed patients financial hardship can happen soon after cancer treatment begins to assemble a nationally representative group of participants the study enrolled patients who were receiving care for metastatic colorectal cancer through the nci community oncology research program ncorp this program brings cancer clinical trials and cancer care delivery studies such as this one to people in community hospitals and centers where most people with cancer in the united states are treated participants were enrolled between june and january they filled out questionnaires about their finances and quality of life within months of their diagnosis and then every months for a year of the patients in the study completed all the questionnaires the median age was most patients were younger than years old and were married or had a partner and had a household income of or less per year overall about of participants reported experiencing financial hardship within months of beginning treatment the researchers defined major financial hardship as having at least one of the following accumulating debt of any amount borrowing money from family and or friends selling or refinancing a home or a or more decline in personal income patient responses on measures of financial hardship new debt at least income decline new loans refinanced home sold home the researchers had expected to find that certain characteristics might put people at greater risk of financial hardship than others but the data did not support that idea we suspected that younger unmarried and patients in historically underserved populations might have a greater chance of experiencing financial hardship but we did not see that association in this study per se said dr shankaran participants with annual household incomes of less than and those with total assets of less than were more likely to experience hardship compared with participants with higher income and assets the researchers found previous studies have estimated that approximately to of cancer survivors face financial hardship though the definition of financial hardship may have varied across studies prior studies may have underestimated the incidence and prevalence of financial hardship by not including patients with advanced disease and those on chronic therapy dr shankaran and her colleagues wrote in the current study patients who experienced major financial hardship in the first months of the study were more likely to report lower overall quality of life scores on their month questionnaires this finding adds to growing evidence about the harmful effects of financial hardship including changes to quality of life noted the authors of the editorial previous studies have found that patients experiencing financial distress have reported lower quality of life scores as well as more symptoms and more pain than patients who were not facing financial challenges larger studies that follow patients over time are needed to understand how financial distress affects the quality of life in patients with advanced cancer noted the authors of a recent study on this topic connecting patients who have financial problems with support services financial issues have often been looked at largely as a long term problem but the new research highlights just how soon after a diagnosis of cancer the financial problems can begin and the cumulative incidence of financial problems increases over time the researchers found screening for financial hardship should start when a person is diagnosed with cancer noted dr de moor and screening should be repeated periodically to identify those who experience financial hardship during treatment and survivorship care she continued health care providers need to proactively communicate with patients about the cost of cancer treatment other expenses associated with undergoing treatment and potential disruptions to their employment dr de moor said the goal is to take steps to minimize financial hardship among patients and their families she added many oncologists and practices including many practices participating in ncorp use a lack of health insurance at a single visit to screen patients who may be at risk of financial difficulties the authors of the editorial noted but this approach would have missed nearly all the patients in the current study who went on to experience financial hardship resources may be available for some people at risk of financial hardship noted dr shankaran including assistance from foundations pharmaceutical companies and organizations that match patients with support services clinics need to connect patients at risk for financial hardship with support services to ensure that patients get the care they need she said motivated patients shared personal financial information the current study focused on patients with metastatic colorectal cancer but financial hardship is likely to be an issue for patients with other advanced cancers as well the researchers noted if you look at financial hardship in patients with lung cancer or breast cancer diseases where people go on treatments and stay on them you would probably see a similar story said dr shankaran patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who survive beyond the month study period could experience further financial deterioration the study authors cautioned future studies they noted should focus on financial issues at the end of a patient s life when the aggressive use of treatments may lead to further financial deterioration as a next step in the research dr shankaran and her swog colleagues recently launched a clinical trial to evaluate whether financial counseling can help ease financial hardship for patients with cancer an overarching goal of the current study was to test the feasibility of collecting financial information from patients for research some of the investigators and staff at the participating ncorp sites initially had doubts that people would be willing to share personal financial information with investigators as it turned out the study enrolled patients more quickly than expected the willingness of patients to share their information and experiences indicates that they felt the research was important and worth their time even when they were undergoing cancer treatment said dr shankaran they were motivated to participate in the research she continued and that bodes well for future studies of financial hardship nci resources on

on mrna vaccine production credit image used with permission from biontech the coronavirus pandemic has thrown a spotlight on messenger rna mrna the molecule that carries a cell s instructions for making proteins hundreds of millions of people worldwide have received mrna vaccines that provide powerful protection against severe covid caused by infection with sars cov as stunningly successful as the mrna covid vaccines have been researchers have long hoped to use mrna vaccines for a very different purpose to treat cancer mrna based cancer treatment vaccines have been tested in small trials for nearly a decade with some promising early results in fact scientists at both pfizer biontech and moderna drew on their experience developing mrna cancer vaccines to create their coronavirus vaccines now some investigators believe the success of the mrna covid vaccines could help accelerate clinical research on mrna vaccines to treat cancer there s a lot of enthusiasm around mrna right now said patrick ott m d ph d who directs the center for personal cancer vaccines at the dana farber cancer institute the funding and resources that are flowing into mrna vaccine research will help the cancer vaccine field dozens of clinical trials are testing mrna treatment vaccines in people with various types of cancer including pancreatic cancer colorectal cancer and melanoma some vaccines are being evaluated in combination with drugs that enhance the body s immune response to tumors but no mrna cancer vaccine has been approved by the us food and drug administration for use either alone or with other cancer treatments mrna vaccine technology is extremely promising for infectious diseases and may lead to new kinds of vaccines said elad sharon m d m p h of nci s division of cancer treatment and diagnosis for other applications such as the treatment of cancer research on mrna vaccines also appears promising but these approaches have not yet proven themselves with findings starting to emerge from ongoing clinical trials of mrna cancer vaccines researchers could soon learn more about the safety and effectiveness of these treatments dr sharon added how do mrna vaccines work over the past years researchers have learned how to engineer stable forms of mrna and deliver these molecules to the body through vaccines once in the body the mrna instructs cells that take up the vaccine to produce proteins that may stimulate an immune response against these same proteins when they are present in intact viruses or tumor cells among the cells likely to take up mrna from a vaccine are dendritic cells which are the sentinels of the immune system after taking up and translating the mrna dendritic cells present the resulting proteins or antigens to immune cells such as t cells starting the immune response dendritic cells act as teachers educating t cells so that they can search for and kill cancer cells or virus infected cells depending on the antigen said karine breckpot ph d of the vrije universiteit brussel in belgium who studies mrna vaccines the mrna included in the pfizer biontech and the moderna coronavirus vaccines instructs cells to produce a version of the spike protein that studs the surface of sars cov the immune system sees the spike protein presented by the dendritic cells as foreign and mobilizes some immune cells to produce antibodies and other immune cells to fight off the apparent infection having been exposed to the spike protein free of the virus the immune system is now prepared or primed to react strongly to a subsequent infection with the actual sars cov virus cancer research led to speedy development of mrna vaccines when the pandemic struck mrna vaccine technology had an unexpected opportunity to demonstrate its promise said norbert pardi ph d of the university of pennsylvania perelman school of medicine whose research focuses on mrna based vaccines the production of mrna vaccines today is easy fast and can be scaled up as needed dr pardi continued the same manufacturing procedure can be applied to any mrna sequence he added historically the process of developing vaccines has taken to years but both the pfizer biontech and the moderna covid vaccines the latter of which was developed in collaboration with nih were designed manufactured and shown to be safe and effective in people in less than a year to develop an infectious disease vaccine during a pandemic you need to be fast said lena kranz ph d co director of cancer vaccines at biontech the current pandemic has confirmed our hypothesis that mrna technology is well suited for fast vaccine development and rapid manufacturing on a global scale the groundwork for the speedy design manufacturing and testing of the mrna covid vaccines was established through decades of work on cancer vaccines during this period immunotherapy including drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors emerged as a new approach to treating cancer leading in some people to dramatic and long lasting responses there s a lot of synergy between research on immunotherapy and mrna cancer vaccines said robert meehan m d senior director of clinical development at moderna vaccines are building on the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors and expanding our knowledge of the underlying biology modifying and protecting the cargo of mrna vaccines technologies that can deliver mrna to the body are essential for the success of these vaccines if an mrna sequence were injected into the body without some form of protection the sequence would be recognized by the immune system as a foreign substance and destroyed a solution employed by some investigational cancer vaccines is to encase the mrna in lipid nanoparticles which are tiny spheres that protect the mrna molecules other delivery vehicles include liposomes which are also a type of vesicle or bubble the most advanced mrna based vaccine platform uses mrna encapsulated in lipid enlarge structure of an mrna lipid nanoparticle with the mrna inside red ribbon like structure and a surrounding layer of fat molecules called peg lipids credit adapted from vaccines january https doi org vaccines cc by nanoparticles said dr pardi now that the pfizer biontech and the moderna coronavirus vaccine trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of lipid nanoparticles the technology could certainly be used in future cancer vaccine trials he added another key feature of the pfizer biontech and the moderna coronavirus vaccines is the use of modified forms of mrna according to jordan meier ph d of nci s center for cancer research who studies mrna modifications the mrna in these vaccines incorporates pseudouridine which is a modification of a naturally occurring nucleoside nucleosides are the building blocks of mrna and the order of specific nucleosides determines the instructions that mrna gives to the protein making machinery in cells the pseudouridine modification seems to make the mrna itself almost invisible to the immune system said dr meier the modification does not alter the function of the mrna but may enhance the effectiveness of the vaccines he added cancer researchers have been testing both modified and unmodified forms of mrna in their investigational treatment vaccines more research is needed to better understand the relative advantages of each approach for the development of cancer vaccines dr meier said developing and testing personalized mrna cancer vaccines for more than a decade cancer researchers have been developing a type of treatment known as a personalized cancer vaccine using various technologies including mrna and protein fragments or peptides the investigational mrna vaccines are manufactured for individuals based on the specific molecular features of their tumors it takes to months to produce a personalized mrna cancer vaccine after tissue samples have been collected from a patient speed is especially important for individualized cancer vaccination said mathias vormehr ph d codirector of cancer vaccines at biontech a highly individualized vaccine combination must be designed and produced within weeks of taking a tumor biopsy with this approach researchers try to elicit an immune response against abnormal proteins or neoantigens produced by cancer cells because these proteins are not found on normal cells they are promising targets for vaccine induced immune responses personalized cancer vaccines may teach the immune system how cancer cells are different from the rest of the body said julie bauman m d deputy director of the university of arizona cancer center dr bauman is co leading a clinical trial testing a personalized mrna vaccine in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced head and neck cancer the study initially included patients with colorectal cancer but this group did not appear to benefit from the therapy for patients with head and neck cancer however the early results were positive among the first participants patients had all signs of their tumors disappear following treatment known as a complete response and another had their tumors shrink we were surprised to see two complete and enduring responses in our first group of patients with head and neck cancers said dr bauman noting that the study has been expanded to include patients with the disease the number of patients treated is small but we are cautiously optimistic she added the study is sponsored by moderna which makes each personalized vaccine in about weeks the manufacturing process starts with the identification of genetic mutations in a patient s tumor cells that could give rise to neoantigens computer algorithms then predict which neoantigens are most likely to bind to receptors on t cells and stimulate an immune response the vaccine can include genetic sequences for up to different neoantigens the promise of personalized immunotherapy with mrna vaccines is being able to activate t cells that will specifically recognize individual cancer cells based on their abnormal molecular features said dr bauman advancing the science of mrna cancer vaccines a lot of immunotherapies stimulate the immune response in a nonspecific way that is not directly against the cancer said dr ott personalized cancer vaccines can direct the immune response to exactly where it needs to be some companies are also investigating mrna cancer vaccines that are based on collections of a few dozen neoantigens that have been linked with certain types of cancer including prostate cancer gastrointestinal cancers and melanoma in addition to clinical trials fundamental research on mrna cancer vaccines continues some investigators are trying to enhance the responses of immune cells to neoantigens in mrna vaccines one study for example aims to improve the responses of t cells that become exhausted while attacking tumors a challenge for the field is learning how best to identify neoantigens for personalized mrna cancer vaccines several researchers said there s still a lot we need to learn and many questions to answer dr ott said it s not yet clear for example how personalized cancer vaccines should be best combined with other treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors he added as cancer researchers pursue these questions other investigators will be developing knowledge from the growing number of people around the world who are receiving mrna coronavirus vaccines insights about the composition of mrna or the way mrna is packaged that emerge from studies of viruses could potentially inform work on cancer vaccines said dr breckpot unfortunately it took a pandemic for there to be broad acceptance of mrna vaccines among the scientific community she added but the global use of covid mrna vaccines has demonstrated the safety of this approach and will open doors for cancer vaccines older post should car t cells be used earlier in people with non hodgkin

by nci staff several approved car t cell therapies work by binding to the cd antigen on cancer cells and killing them credit adapted from frontiers in immunology nov doi fimmu cc by a form of immunotherapy known as car t cell therapy is increasingly being used to treat some people with the blood cancer non hodgkin lymphoma nhl to date however car t cell therapy is used only after patients have already received several lines of treatment but it has not been clear whether the use of car t cell therapies earlier in a patient s course of disease would be more effective against their cancer than the standard treatment of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant new results from three large clinical trials now suggest that after initial chemotherapy car t cell therapies may be more effective than standard treatment these results could herald a change in clinical practice several researchers said with car t cell therapies being used earlier in the course of disease all three studies involved patients with aggressive b cell nhl the most common form of nhl whose cancer had returned early or gotten worse following their initial treatment in two of three trials called zuma and transform patients who received car t cell therapy after just one round of chemotherapy lived longer without their disease progressing than patients who underwent the standard treatment approach that approach usually involves additional or salvage chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant the third trial called belinda however found no difference in how long patients lived without their cancer getting worse regardless of whether they were treated with car t cell therapy or the standard approach in an interim analysis of data from the zuma trial the researchers estimated that more patients treated with car t cell therapy were alive after years than those who received the standard treatment in the belinda and transform trials it was too early to determine whether there was a difference in how long patients lived overall each trial used a different type of car t cell therapy zuma used axicabtagene ciloleucel yescarta transform used lisocabtagene maraleucel breyanzi and belinda used tisagenlecleucel kymriah results from all three trials were presented at the american society of hematology ash annual meeting which took place from december to results from zuma and belinda were published december and respectively in the new england journal of medicine nejm results from transform are available in an ash meeting abstract it is unclear whether the conflicting results from the belinda study mean that tisagenlecleucel is less effective than the other two car t cell therapies tested said lymphoma specialist christopher melani m d of nci s center for cancer research who was not involved in any of the trials there were key differences in how each trial was conducted and the patients included in each study which may have affected the results dr melani explained so without a head to head study comparing the car t cell therapies against each other i don t think we re going to know he said nonetheless two of the three trials show that car t cell therapies are more effective than salvage chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant dr melani said i think the results from the zuma and transform trials are really quite remarkable said laurie sehn m d a lymphoma specialist at the university of british columbia faculty of medicine during an ash press briefing on the studies i think it s inevitable that car t cell therapies will become the standard of care for second line treatment of patients with aggressive nhl which therapy is best for treating chemo resistant nhl for patients with aggressive b cell nhl the standard first line treatment is chemotherapy first line chemotherapy will cure approximately of patients overall dr melani said but for the of patients whose cancer doesn t respond to chemotherapy or returns after initially responding outcomes are uncertain at best the standard second line treatment often begins with salvage chemotherapy most salvage chemotherapy regimens will have some effect in upwards of half of people with aggressive b cell nhl but salvage chemotherapy alone usually does not lead to long lasting remission said dr melani patients who do respond to salvage chemotherapy typically go on to receive a stem cell transplant if they are healthy enough to undergo one but more than half of patients receiving salvage chemotherapy will not receive a transplant said michael bishop m d of the university of chicago s david and etta jonas center for cellular therapy the lead researcher of the belinda trial if patients don t respond adequately to salvage chemotherapy they won t be eligible for a transplant dr bishop said although this sequence of treatments cures some patients it only leads to long lasting remissions in less than of patients who receive it at the same time car t cell therapies used after two or more prior treatments have had impressive results we are likely curing somewhere between and of people with relapsed or refractory aggressive b cell nhl with car t cell therapy after salvage chemotherapy has failed dr melani said so researchers wondered whether car t cell therapies could be used not just after salvage chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant but as second line treatment in place of these other treatments zuma transform and belinda similarities and differences the three studies presented at the ash meeting were all phase clinical trials that compared car t cell therapy with the standard of care in people whose b cell nhl had come back after initial treatment zuma was funded by kite pharma transform by celgene and belinda by novartis pharmaceuticals the respective manufacturers of the car t cell therapies studied in each trial the zuma trial which evaluated axicabtagene enrolled patients transform which tested lisocabtagene enrolled and the tisagenleucel study belinda enrolled patients after enrollment patients were randomly assigned to receive either the car t cell therapy or salvage chemotherapy if possible patients in the salvage chemotherapy group went on to receive a stem cell transplant in all three trials researchers measured the length of time between a patient s enrollment and when important events occur such as disease progression death or beginning a new treatment this measure is called event free survival like all car t cell therapies each of the three therapies tested are produced by a complex manufacturing process in which the gene for an engineered protein called a chimeric antigen receptor or car is added to patient s t cells to help them better attack cancer although they share many features the three car t cell therapies used in the trials have some important differences including in the costimulatory portion of the chimeric antigen receptor the costimulatory domain is essential for full t cell activity the method by which a patient s t cells are genetically engineered also differs between the therapies another difference was in the use of bridging chemotherapy that some patients who receive car t cell therapies undergo to slow disease progression while the car t cells are being manufactured the length of the manufacturing process can vary but usually takes at least weeks whereas belinda allowed for multiple rounds of bridging chemotherapy transform allowed for only a single round and zuma did not allow for any bridging chemotherapy allowing bridging chemotherapy could affect the patient population of a trial since sicker patients can be included in trials that use bridging in zuma and transform patients randomly assigned to receive car t cell therapy had longer event free survival than those randomly assigned to receive the standard treatment of salvage chemotherapy plus a stem cell transplant if possible patients treated with car t cell therapy also were much more likely to have their cancer completely eradicated a complete response for patients in the belinda trial however event free survival and the complete response rate were the same in both groups according to dr sehn the transform and zuma results are likely to change patient treatment moving forward it s remarkable that the results are so favorable compared with standard of care she said but why did belinda not show a difference when the other two studies did in an editorial published in nejm in response to the belinda and zuma trials mark roschewski m d of nci s center for cancer research and colleagues noted that because belinda allowed for bridging chemotherapy it may have included more patients with very aggressive disease than zuma based on previous studies it doesn t seem like tisagenlecleucel should be less effective than the other two car t cell therapies dr melani said instead he agreed that the inconsistent results between belinda and the two other trials could reflect their different trial designs and patient populations side effects were similar across all three trials and overall severe side effects were uncommon cytokine release syndrome crs a common and potentially life threatening side effect of car t cell treatments occurred in all three trials crs occurred most frequently among zuma trial participants with of patients experiencing crs but only experiencing severe crs in the belinda trial of patients experienced crs while only had severe crs in the transform trial about half of patients had crs symptoms and only one severe crs event of patients was reported optimizing car t cell therapy for nhl the differing results between these three trials provide interesting possibilities for future research said dr melani a study directly comparing car t cell therapies could help resolve whether one therapy is more effective than the other two for example at the moment no such trials are planned additionally car t cell therapy does not work for all patients and we have no effective way to predict who s going to be cured versus not with car t cells dr melani said further research is needed to identify features of a patient s disease that makes it particularly susceptible to car t cell therapies he added based on the results from zuma and belinda dr roschewski and his colleagues concluded that patients who can undergo car t cell therapy without bridging chemotherapy should receive car t cells as second line therapy however they cautioned it is premature to conclude that car t cell therapy is superior for all stem cell transplant eligible patients dr bishop agreed i think we need to look at differences between the three trials to try and define which patients benefit the most from car t cell therapies dr bishop said

january by nci staff results from an international clinical trial are expected to help guide decisions about the role of surgery in people with recurrent ovarian cancer credit istock in more than of people with ovarian cancer the cancer comes back after initial treatment when ovarian cancer does recur patients may have additional surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible before starting chemotherapy again but it s been unclear whether this additional or secondary surgery improves how long people live several large studies have set out to resolve this question so far two of them have reached different conclusions in one clinical trial conducted mainly in the united states and asia secondary surgery did not improve how long people lived overall or without their cancer progressing researchers reported in these results from a trial called gog led some experts to strongly question the role of secondary surgery now results from the second large clinical trial known as desktop iii show that among patients who meet a strict set of criteria secondary surgery followed by chemotherapy can improve survival compared with chemotherapy alone initial results from a third trial called soc which was conducted in china showed that people who had secondary surgery lived longer without their cancer progressing than those who did not have surgery researchers are awaiting final results of the soc study but the patient populations that participated in each of the three studies were very different the eligibility criteria for desktop iii which was conducted mainly in europe were developed to help doctors identify those patients most likely to benefit from a second operation upon recurrence explained yovanni casablanca m d a gynecologic oncologist at walter reed national military medical center the patients most likely to benefit are those for whom secondary surgery can remove all visible disease said dr casablanca who was not involved with any of the trials the biggest takeaway from these studies is that there is not a one size fits all approach to treating recurrent ovarian cancer said gynecologic oncologist sarah temkin m d associate director for clinical research in nih s office of research on women s health who was not involved with any of the trials results of desktop iii which were published december in the new england journal of medicine mean that surgery is back on the table as an important part of treatment in a select group of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer dr casablanca said for individuals who meet strict criteria surgery could or even should be considered but only if a patient has access to an experienced and skilled surgeon said elise kohn m d head of gynecologic cancer therapeutics in nci s cancer therapy evaluation program who was not involved with the studies that s because secondary surgery can be challenging to perform if the cancer has spread more widely if a patient s care team feels that secondary surgery is not likely to be successful in removing all signs of the cancer patients should not be exposed to a potentially harmful surgical treatment wrote the desktop iii researchers led by philipp harter m d ph d a gynecologic oncologist at kliniken essen mitte in germany identifying patients most likely to benefit from secondary surgery when ovarian cancer does return how and where tumors grow and spread in the body can vary widely from patient to patient said ginger gardner m d a gynecologic oncologist at memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc who also was not involved with any of the three studies so we need to have as many strategies as we can to best eliminate or control it sometimes the cancer is in one or two spots but sometimes tumors are sprinkled across multiple organs which requires a longer and more complicated operation dr gardner said most people with recurrent ovarian cancer will have had surgery and chemotherapy when their disease was first diagnosed and questions like whether the patient can physically handle secondary surgery and whether the cancer is in one or more spots that the surgeon can access start to come into play she continued the desktop iii clinical trial enrolled people with recurrent ovarian cancer nearly all of whom had received chemotherapy after their initial diagnosis to be eligible for the study patients had to have been in remission and not receiving chemotherapy for at least months in addition trial participants had to meet three criteria that were chosen to maximize the chances that secondary surgery would be successful first when they were initially treated for cancer surgery must have removed all visible disease second they had to be fully active and able to carry out daily activities without restrictions and third they had to have little or no buildup of fluid in their abdomen a large buildup of this fluid known as ascites is a sign that the cancer has spread more widely dr casablanca explained all participants were treated at specialized medical centers that do many surgeries on people with ovarian cancer they were randomly assigned to receive either surgery followed by chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone people in the surgery group lived for a median of about months after starting treatment compared with months in the no surgery group people in the surgery group also lived longer without their cancer progressing than those in the no surgery group surgeons were able to completely remove visible disease in of patients who underwent the procedure median survival in such patients was more than double that of patients who did not have all the cancer removed months versus months the investigators in desktop iii were doing very hard surgeries with good results dr casablanca noted patients experienced few complications of surgery indicating that the overall quality of surgical care was high and overall quality of life was similar among people in the surgery and no surgery groups no one size fits all approach for treating recurrent ovarian cancer although not everyone will be able to tolerate and benefit from secondary surgery the results of desktop iii indicate that surgery should be part of our toolbox for achieving the best result for our patients dr gardner said we need to use precision in the selection of medical and surgical options the right treatment for the right patient dr gardner and dennis chi m d a gynecologic surgeon at mskcc wrote in an editorial accompanying the desktop iii results a few factors could explain the differing results of the three trials dr gardner and others said one key difference is that whereas the desktop iii and soc investigators used standardized criteria for selecting participants the patient selection criteria in gog were much more fluid dr gardner said in that trial whether a patient was eligible to undergo surgery was based on an individual surgeon s judgment of whether their cancer could be completely removed surgically although differences between the studies make it hard to compare them head to head the results from both the desktop and soc trials define criteria where surgery is valuable and warn against its use in broader circumstances dr kohn said as dr casablanca emphasized when someone has their first recurrence of ovarian cancer we need to pause and ask if they meet the selection criteria outlined by desktop iii those judgments should be made by a gynecologic oncologist a specialist trained in managing ovarian cancer with both surgery and drug therapy she and other experts said findings may not apply in all settings if surgery is indeed an option dr casablanca said we should be thoughtful about where that surgery is performed and who performs it we may not see the same outcomes of secondary surgery in community practice if we don t have the same level of surgical quality dr casablanca cautioned indeed said dr temkin few us women with ovarian cancer are treated at hospitals or medical centers that do a high volume of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer and many never see a gynecologic oncologist even at the time of diagnosis because they lack access to specialized care as a result dr temkin said i think that the desktop iii trial results are applicable to only a small number of us patients with ovarian cancer finally she noted we ve seen a widening of disparities in ovarian cancer survival in recent decades due mainly to lack of access to high quality medical care survival for white patients with ovarian cancer has improved significantly over the last few decades because we have new treatments and new drugs but for black patients and those living in rural settings ovarian cancer survival hasn t really improved she said

january by nci staff companies must now submit an application to fda to keep selling existing e cigarette products or to sell new e cigarette products credit istock the food and drug administration fda first attempted to regulate e cigarettes more than a decade ago the regulations would have treated e cigarettes as what the agency calls drug device combination products what followed was a series of lawsuits and court rulings starting in the agency was able to begin regulating e cigarettes this time as tobacco products under those regulations companies must submit an application to fda to keep selling existing e cigarette products or to sell new products after further lawsuits and delays some caused by the covid pandemic a september court ordered deadline was established for companies to submit applications to fda seeking to market their e cigarette products in the united states in this interview mitch zeller j d director of fda s center for tobacco products provides insights into how e cigarettes are regulated and recent fda actions on e cigarettes the agency reported that it has received marketing applications from more than companies for millions of e cigarette products did you anticipate receiving so many we knew it was going to be a lot most of the applications came in during the final days and weeks leading up to the september deadline and we were not surprised when the final tally was that it was applications for just under million products we were prepared both operationally and from a scientific review standpoint and to fast forward to today we have taken final action one way or the other on more than million of the almost million products that were the subject of timely submitted applications to get fda approval to sell a prescription drug in the united states you have to prove that the drug is safe and effective what is required to get fda to clear an e cigarette for marketing approval we don t talk about approving tobacco products because tobacco products are inherently harmful and are not judged by the same standard as drugs instead we talk about marketing authorizations but it s a very important distinction between the safety and efficacy standard for approving drugs and the one needed to issue marketing authorization for e cigarettes the statutory standard for tobacco products is this very general population level public health standard the words of the statute are appropriate for the protection of the public health that s the standard we use how do you apply that standard in practice it is a general standard but congress did include mandatory considerations in the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act and so by law when we get one of these applications we have to consider the product s impact on existing users of cigarettes and other tobacco products and on nonusers of the product with regard to users the question is will they continue to use the tobacco product that they re already using or will they switch to the new tobacco product that s in the application for nonusers the question is will any of them initiate use of the new product and it s basically a net assessment at the population level of the benefits and risks of that new product mitch zeller j d director fda center for tobacco products credit food and drug administration and the burden is on the company by law to demonstrate that the marketing of their product is appropriate for the protection of the public health how do you weigh benefit versus harm of e cigarettes what does that involve most e cigarettes are flavored and the national youth tobacco survey found that more than million middle and high school kids were current users of e cigarettes and that approximately used a flavored product the flavors that are the most popular with kids are fruit candy mint and menthol so when it comes to flavored e cigarettes we have this built in concern about the popularity of those products with kids at the same time there s a very important ongoing debate about e cigarettes and harm reduction for adults and it s a very fair question to ask what is the potential benefit for adults of switching from conventional cigarettes to e cigarettes especially if there s complete switching to an e cigarette where they can still inhale nicotine but they re inhaling a fraction of the chemicals that are in every puff of conventional cigarette smoke that goes into the lungs but when it comes to kids the harm reduction question doesn t apply because kids should not be inhaling any of these products into their lungs ultimately the legal burden is on the companies to demonstrate that the benefit to adults is going to outweigh the harm to kids and that s why we would be looking for either a randomized controlled trial a longitudinal cohort study or some other kind of rich and robust data to show proof of a benefit if we don t see any of the kind of science that should be there to demonstrate benefit that s an application that s probably headed for a denial then there s tobacco flavored e cigarettes and in that case the benefit harm equation is different because tobacco flavored e cigarettes are not nearly as popular with kids as flavored e cigarettes and so that s how we have been able to authorize some tobacco flavored e cigarettes for marketing there have been concerns about the safety of the liquids used in e cigarettes whether they contain potentially dangerous chemicals as part of the application process do companies have to prove that the liquid itself is safe they have to give us all the chemistry and toxicology data and they have to identify what s in the product including the liquid and the aerosol it generates we can also do physical inspections of their manufacturing facilities or remote records inspections to verify the information in an application so one of the ways that an application can fail is at a stage before we even get to scientific review when there isn t enough of the necessary information about the product for us to be able to conduct a review we have rejected applications for millions of products on that basis many e cigarettes were on the market before the requirement to apply for marketing authorization are any of those still out there because the applications for those products haven t been reviewed yet the answer is it depends we have found products on the market for which the company never submitted an application when that happens we send those companies a warning letter telling them that they need to remove those products from the market and if they don t they risk us taking them to court then there are products that were on the market already and that were the subject of an application that was submitted by the deadline but we haven t gotten to their application yet in your view is there strong evidence that e cigarettes can help current smokers quit what are you seeing in the applications you ve received as for evidence there is what s in the literature and then there is what s in the applications that come in as i said it s in the company s best interest if they ve done a randomized controlled trial or they ve done the right kind of cohort study to submit that kind of data to us and we also look at the published literature and what the literature tells us and what the us preventive services task force tells us is there s insufficient evidence at a population level that e cigarettes are effective for smoking cessation that s not to say that e cigarettes haven t helped some people transition away from conventional cigarettes i m sure that they have but if people are looking for products to help them quit there are fda approved prescription and over the counter medications some with nicotine some without that are safe and effective and have been proven to help people quit especially when combined with smoking cessation counseling i don t want to diminish the anecdotal reports because we ve gotten the letters and the emails and i have no reason to doubt the individuals that said if it weren t for this product i would still be smoking cigarettes but again we can t make the regulatory decisions that we need to make on the basis of just anecdotal reports could e cigarettes be something that a doctor could prescribe to a patient to help them quit smoking yes that actually could happen that s up to the e cigarette companies because the companies get to decide what kind of authorization they want to seek from fda there s no reason why an e cigarette company can t say thank you center for tobacco products but we d rather our product be regulated as a drug and we re going to submit applications to the center for drug evaluation and research that s their choice and in that case the product would be subject to the safety and efficacy standard the company must provide the required data which includes the results from two adequate and well controlled trials and then the center for drug evaluation and research would determine whether the evidence is strong enough to warrant an indication as a drug so theoretically the answer to your question is yes and nobody has taken the drug pathway yet well if they have it s not public because that s not a public process but one can look around and see that no e cigarettes have been approved for use as safe and effective cessation aids

subscribe december by nci staff through accure health care professionals were trained to understand and respond to the struggles black people with cancer often face credit illustration by storyset https storyset com although there have been significant improvements in cancer treatment and prevention through the years a stark reality remains in many communities black people with cancer don t live as long as white people with the disease a collaborative group is tackling this problem head on making system wide changes in how cancer centers manage patient care to directly address some of the key drivers of this disparity a recent study showed that their approach has the potential to help shrink differences in how long black and white patients with early stage lung and breast cancer live the potential benefit the study showed even goes beyond that by improving survival for all patients with these two cancers experts largely agree that the biggest reason for the long standing difference in survival is structural and cultural barriers such as difficulties affording co pays on medicines and poor communication about treatment side effects that make it harder for black patients to complete their cancer treatment so the group created a comprehensive program that proactively identified and addressed structural and cultural barriers for every patient the program called accountability for cancer through undoing racism and equity accure put systems in place that act as safety nets to help make sure no patient falls through the cracks whether they are black or white said one of the study leaders matthew manning m d a radiation oncologist at cone health cancer center in greensboro north carolina the group had previously shown that accure helped black and white patients complete cancer treatment at equal rates new data from the study suggest that the approach may narrow differences in year survival rates between black and white patients with breast or lung cancer other research projects have addressed what can be changed in vulnerable communities or what health behaviors can be changed by individuals said christina yongue m p h a former project manager for accure and a professor at the university of north carolina greensboro the novelty of accure she said is that it intentionally addresses the changes cancer centers can make within their own institutions to ameliorate racial disparities it s a moment of awakening that we can make a difference to improve the quality of care that patients receive she said ms yongue and dr manning reported the findings at the american society for radiation oncology and american public health association annual meetings on october a multilevel approach to tackling cancer disparities accure s beginnings grew out of the greensboro health disparities collaborative a diverse group of leaders from the greensboro community who conduct research and create programs to make health outcomes more equal by race in the late s the organization led focus groups with community members to identify barriers to cancer care and to brainstorm potential solutions accure was an implementation of those solutions dr manning said in addition to experts from the greensboro health disparities collaborative the nci funded study involved researchers and staff from cone health cancer center the universities of north carolina at chapel hill and greensboro the university of pittsburgh medical center and sisters network greensboro the intervention included three main parts to improve the rate of treatment completion the first was a set of nurse navigators who were trained to understand and respond to the struggles black patients often face such as mistrust of the medical establishment miscommunication with their doctors limited access to transportation financial hardships and difficulties taking time off work these navigators met face to face with each participant several times during the study second a program was created to alert these nurse navigators in real time if a patient missed an appointment or didn t meet an expected treatment milestone such as surgery within days of their first appointment a nurse navigator then acted as a patient advocate to see what issues the patient was facing and if they could be resolved with available resources such as free transportation to and from appointments telehealth visits rescheduling appointments advice on pain management or financial assistance for utilities rent or gas and third to enhance accountability clinical teams were updated monthly on the rates of treatment completion among black and white patients that s a shift from the cancer centers standard practice of viewing outcomes individually or independent of race ms yongue explained many studies focus on single barriers to care but this was a multilevel intervention study that explored patient and provider factors in real time in order to make the necessary adjustments said veronica chollette r n of nci s health systems and interventions research branch who oversaw accure s funding and progress improving survival for everybody with cancer regardless of race the new analysis included more than people who had been diagnosed with early stage breast or lung cancer between and at a cone health facility and who participated in accure for comparison the researchers looked at the outcomes of about patients with early stage breast or lung cancer who had been treated between and and who did not participate in accure to see if the intervention helped black patients live as long as white patients the team looked at the percentage of patients who were still alive years after their diagnosis before accure was introduced there were small differences in the year survival rates between black and white people with lung and breast cancer for breast cancer and for lung cancer with the implementation of accure survival rates increased for both black and white people in addition the small gaps in survival rates between black and white patients seemed to shrink to for breast cancer and for lung cancer the study groups were not big enough to show a statistically significant difference in survival rates between black in white patients before accure dr manning noted but given that the survival rates for black patients substantially improved with accure the team believes the intervention has the potential to resolve survival disparities a larger study would be needed to confirm that dr manning added addressing barriers to cancer treatment most cancer centers have resources to help patients such as taxi vouchers and assistance paying bills dr manning explained but the centers often don t know which patients need these resources until they ve already fallen off track what accure did was make it standard operating procedure to identify what those barriers are for everyone that way we didn t have to be reactive we could be proactive he said the old way of doing things also put the blame on the patient ms yongue said those who frequently missed appointments or didn t complete treatment used to be called noncompliant patients dr manning added if we can look at it at the institutional level rather than blaming individual patients then it changes the conversation he said i think accure helped to show us that that can be successful beyond cancer the team is confident that this sort of approach could help resolve long standing racial disparities in other areas of medicine such as diabetes hypertension and pregnancy and childbirth complications ms chollette agreed the approach could be modified to local needs and tailored to address health disparities observed with other cancers she said for example she continued rural populations are quite challenged with adherence to care due to structural geographic and environmental barriers i think this model could be applied to rural areas where we are seeing health disparities in cervical cancer including low hpv vaccine uptake the accure model is already being adopted in other parts of the country the study researchers are currently helping various health

december by nci staff three dimensional structure of a melanoma cell credit sriram subramaniam nci results from a large study are expected to help determine the best treatment approach for some people with an advanced form of melanoma the nci sponsored clinical trial called dreamseq included people with metastatic melanoma whose tumors had a specific mutation in the braf gene called v it tested initially giving patients a combination of the immunotherapy drugs ipilimumab yervoy and nivolumab opdivo or a combination of the targeted therapies dabrafenib tafinlar and trametinib mekinist in both patient groups once the initial treatment was no longer working they were switched to the other treatment combination more of the patients treated first with immunotherapy drugs were alive at years compared to patients treated first with the targeted therapy combination versus the difference was substantial enough that the trial was stopped early by its data safety and monitoring board both drug combinations have been found to be effective in people with advanced melanoma but for the estimated of people whose melanomas have a braf v mutation researchers didn t know which treatment combination was better to use first for these patients there now appears to be an answer according to michael atkins m d of the georgetown lombardi comprehensive cancer center who led the trial the findings support an immediate change in clinical practice and will have a significant impact on clinical care dr atkins presented results from the trial as part of the american society of clinical oncology virtual plenary series on november the results are spectacular said elad sharon m d who helps lead immunotherapy trials in nci s cancer therapy evaluation program but was not involved in the dreamseq trial not only were the results impressive enough that you can see a difference between the treatments you saw so much of a difference that they were able to stop the trial early checkpoint inhibitors versus braf targeted therapies when caught early melanoma is curable often with surgery alone but if the cancer spreads or metastasizes it s much more difficult to treat however substantial progress has been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma over the last decade including the discovery of cancer fueling braf mutations and the development of therapies that target tumors with these mutations dabrafenib which blocks the activity of v mutated braf proteins was first approved by the food and drug administration fda in as a standalone treatment for advanced melanoma with certain mutations in the braf gene and the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib was approved in trametinib inhibits the activity of a different protein called mek that often works in conjunction with braf it is also approved for advanced melanoma that has certain braf mutations dabrafenib and trametinib are both taken as pills soon after these targeted therapies were developed a new category of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors rapidly emerged as effective treatments for melanoma these drugs block proteins on cancer cells or immune cells called immune checkpoints blocking immune checkpoint proteins helps immune cells find and kill cancer cells both ipilimumab and nivolumab were initially approved as standalone treatments for patients with metastatic melanoma in they were approved in combination to treat people with metastatic melanoma regardless of whether their tumors had braf mutations ipilimumab and nivolumab are administered intravenously before the dreamseq trial a key consideration in choosing which class of drugs to use as an initial treatment was their side effects the side effects of these two types of therapy are completely different dr atkins explained because the braf mutation only occurs in the tumor targeted therapies specifically target tumor cells and generally cause fewer effects in healthy cells although the dabrafenib trametinib combination does cause side effects most commonly fatigue fever joint problems and nausea they don t tend to be life threatening immunotherapy drugs like nivolumab and ipilimumab can cause the immune system to get overactivated and attack a patient s healthy tissues dr atkins said these side effects are often more severe and involve a variety of organs the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab can sometimes permanently damage normal organs like the thyroid gland or the pituitary gland he continued people with these side effects may have to take hormone replacement therapy for the rest of their lives because the side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors tended to be more severe than those caused by targeted therapies for many people it was easier to consider using the braf targeted drugs if the patient s tumor had a braf mutation dr sharon said however no study had compared the two treatment regimens directly we had these two new effective treatment strategies for patients with advanced braf melanoma dr atkins summarized and the question was which of these approaches is better and given that patients would have access to both of these approaches is there a particular sequence of those two approaches that lead to the best outcome results from the dreamseq trial the dreamseq trial which was led by the ecog acrin research group included people with metastatic melanoma whose tumors had braf v mutations the trial was sponsored by nci but also included funding from bristol meyers squibb the manufacturer of ipilimumab and nivolumab and novartis pharmaceuticals the manufacturer of dabrafenib and trametinib about of patients had already received some form of postsurgical adjuvant treatment for melanoma when they joined the trial first patients were randomly assigned to receive either combination immunotherapy ipilimumab plus nivolumab or combination targeted therapy dabrafenib plus trametinib if a patient s cancer was resistant to initial treatment and progressed or initially responded to treatment only to return later they received the second treatment option patients who had initially received immunotherapy switched to the targeted therapy combination and those who had started with the targeted therapies switched to the immunotherapy combination overall people moved on to the second treatment option who first received immunotherapy and who first received targeted therapies more than half of people who did not switch to a second drug option did so because their cancers did not progress so they stuck with the therapy they were initially assigned the rest did experience disease progression but either died before they could begin the second therapy option or did not move on for other reasons before enough time had passed for more patients to begin treatment with a second drug due to disease progression the trial was stopped early by the data safety monitoring board after reviewing data from the first patients the safety board found that of patients who were initially treated with the immunotherapy combination whether or not they went on to receive the targeted therapy combination were still alive years after starting treatment among those initially treated with targeted therapies were still alive after years when the trial was stopped participants who were still receiving initial treatment with the targeted therapies were immediately given the option to switch to the ipilimumab nivolumab combination i think standard of care should immediately change because these are fda approved regimens said dr atkins physicians seeing these results should consider patients who are on initial targeted therapy for a switch to immunotherapy most patients who participated in the trial experienced serious side effects overall however serious side effects occurred most often in patients who received immunotherapy as their initial treatment treatment group first line serious side effects second line serious side effects immunotherapy targeted therapy three people died as a result of treatment two people who had been treated only with combination immunotherapy died one from an inflammatory heart condition called myocarditis and one from gastrointestinal side effects one person died as the result of a stroke while being treated with second line targeted therapy patients with braf advanced melanoma should first receive an immunotherapy combination dr sharon agreed you would have to have some significant reason why the targeted therapy combination would be better for a particular patient nonetheless he acknowledged there is probably a higher risk of fatal side effects associated with immunotherapy treatments and that is something patients have to be aware of following up on a practice changing result while the path ahead for these specific treatment options seems clear there are some questions that dreamseq is unable to answer the results from the trial show that in general initial immunotherapy results in better overall survival for people with advanced braf melanoma however for a small proportion of patients targeted therapies seemed to prevent death shortly after beginning treatment often called early death better than immunotherapies researchers are working on identifying markers for who s going to respond best to particular therapies dr atkins explained because dreamseq only tested two specific drug combinations it s not clear whether other available therapies alone or different combinations of therapies may produce better results also newer therapies have been developed that were not tested in this trial for example in fda approved atezolizumab tecentriq another immune checkpoint inhibitor for use in combination with the targeted braf inhibitors

december by nci staff geriatric assessments can potentially identify older adults at highest risk of serious side effects from cancer treatment credit istock for older adults undergoing treatment for advanced cancer results from a clinical trial show that a health measurement tool called a geriatric assessment can be an important part of treatment planning in the trial older patients whose care was guided by a geriatric assessment were much less likely to experience serious side effects in the study community hospital and clinic staff could use the information and care recommendations provided by the geriatric assessments to help make treatment choices for some patients they could decrease the intensity of the treatment older adults received increase the amount of supportive care or do both compared with people in the study who didn t receive geriatric assessment guided care the usual care group people who received assessment guided care the intervention group not only experienced fewer side effects they also were less likely to experience falls in their homes during treatment however no differences in survival were seen between the two treatment groups findings from the study were published november in the lancet older adults with other health problems such as other diseases or physical disabilities are rarely included in cancer clinical trials explained supriya mohile m d a geriatric oncologist at the university of rochester s wilmot cancer institute who led the study which was funded in part by nci that means that in real world settings where older patients often have other health conditions clinicians don t necessarily know the optimal doses of commonly used therapies that balance effectively treating their cancer with limiting treatment related side effects historically there s been a concern about undertreatment of older adults but for those with aging related conditions and advanced cancer we re probably overtreating them she said in this study the geriatric assessment changed the decisions clinicians made about treatment and that led to lower toxicity the fact that there was no difference in how long patients lived despite receiving lower dosages of chemotherapy is important added diane st germain r n m s of nci s division of cancer prevention dcp who was not involved with the study chronological age vs physiological age age is in many respects just a number and it would be ageist to say that all older adults should be treated the same said dr mohile but older adults with cancer often have other health problems these include cognitive challenges health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes and a general decrease in what s known as physiologic reserve physiologic reserve is the ability to recover from something that s difficult whether it s cancer and its symptoms or cancer treatment dr mohile said a geriatric assessment collects information about these health problems or comorbidities and impairments that otherwise tend not to be captured as part of routine cancer care see the table for examples these evaluations can potentially identify older adults at highest risk of serious side effects from cancer treatment geriatric assessments help clinicians to determine if a year old is for example physiologically as healthy as the average or year old or if they re physiologically closer in health to the average year old said judith hopkins m d an oncologist with novant health in north carolina who participated in the trial and that helps predict treatment toxicity she said enlarge such concerns can be particularly important for people with advanced cancer when treatment is not expected to provide a cure instead therapy in these cases is palliative that is it is intended to reduce symptoms of the cancer and improve quality of life you don t want to take independent older patients and put them in a situation where you might substantially improve their cancer but they can no longer live independently or enjoy the parts of life that mean the most to them dr hopkins many professional societies recommend doing a geriatric assessment for every adult over the age of who is about to start cancer treatment but before this trial it was unclear whether using these assessments in community hospitals and clinics where most people receive cancer care could reduce the side effects of treatment the clinical trial took place at practice clusters across the country affiliated with the university of rochester s hub of the nci community oncology research program ncorp a national network that brings cancer clinical trials to community based practices practice clusters are groups of community oncology clinics that share one or more doctor nurse or other health care team member all practice clusters received training on how to perform a geriatric assessment and a temporary staff member who could assist with the assessments the assessments were given to more than patients aged and older during the study but what happened after the assessment differed depending on whether health care providers received the results of the assessment in the usual care group summaries of the assessments were not made available to the doctors in the intervention group the assessment summaries along with patient management recommendations were sent to patients oncologists in the intervention group we gave the oncologists autonomy they could do whatever they wanted with the assessment dr mohile explained they could throw it in the trash but they didn t because they thought they were really important they looked at the summaries they processed them and they decided to adjust treatment delivery based on them she said more than of the oncologists in the intervention group implemented at least one management recommendation from the summaries making cancer treatment more tolerable the treatment adjustments implemented by the oncologists took many forms for example of people in the intervention group compared with of those in the usual care group received a single chemotherapy drug instead of a combination of two or more drugs which have the potential to cause more side effects and almost of people in the intervention group compared with of those in the usual care group started treatment with lower than normal doses instead of receiving a dose reduction later during treatment if needed these adjustments led to a lower rate of serious side effects whereas about of people in the usual care group experienced one or more serious side effects including fatigue nausea and vomiting and infection during treatment only of people whose doctors used information from the geriatric assessment did almost of people in the usual care group required a dose reduction due to treatment side effects compared with just over in the intervention group the intervention group also received more supportive care including referrals to social workers or nutritionists and importantly dr mohile explained adjustments to medications taken for other health conditions the use of several medications at the same time sometimes called polypharmacy has the potential to magnify the side effects of cancer treatments she continued for example drugs commonly used to treat conditions like high blood pressure diabetes and depression and anxiety can compound dehydration dizziness and other side effects from cancer treatment that are risk factors for falls you have to be proactive about stopping or adjusting those medications when possible she added overall of people in the usual care group experienced a fall over the months of the study compared with in the intervention group making geriatric assessment accessible this is the first nationwide study to show that using a geriatric assessment to make specific changes to how older cancer patients get treated makes a difference to them that it allows them to have fewer serious consequences from therapy said lori minasian m d also of nci s dcp who was not involved with the study now that it s been clearly demonstrated that using the assessment works are there ways to modify it make it easier and more streamlined for a variety of different scenarios dr minasian asked implementing such assessments as they re done now would likely be challenging for many community practices said dr hopkins unfortunately most health care systems don t have dedicated staff in a clinic to do this on a regular basis some of the ncorp clinics that signed up for the trial could not enroll any patients because of such staffing issues even with the temporary help provided through the trial dr hopkins explained a new patient visit might be a or minute slot or an hour adding a geriatric assessment takes on average about minutes that becomes very challenging she said dr hopkins and other members of an american society of clinical oncology working group are currently creating a simplified geriatric assessment that could be mostly completed by patients and their families at home or in the waiting room then the remainder could be done by the physician while they re doing the patient history and physical exam she explained i m very hopeful that in the next year we ll have a template that can be distributed to physicians that can improve patient care without interfering with clinic workflow said dr hopkins the team is also planning on creating a training video to teach community oncologists how to perform and interpret the assessment and how to use it to guide patient care for now dr hopkins added older adults with cancer who want to get a geriatric assessment before treatment may be able to have one done by a geriatrician if such a specialist is available in their community these things can be scheduled separately from an oncology office visit she said there are also resources available for doctors who want to implement geriatric assessments at their hospital or clinic now dr mohile said for example the cancer and aging research group an association of geriatric oncology researchers will connect interested oncologists with others around the country who have already implemented geriatric assessments in their practice for advice and mentorship she explained more work is needed to understand which groups of older adults would benefit most from geriatric assessment explained st germain research is also needed to determine which components of such an assessment are most useful in different types of cancer because it may not be feasible or necessary to conduct a comprehensive geriatric assessment in all older adults with cancer she said for example the most useful components may be different for patients with early stage breast cancer compared with those with acute leukemia but it s now been clearly demonstrated that geriatric assessment works said dr minasian the next step is to streamline it and refine it for specific populations in a way that benefits both patients and practices older post tumors may shed protein to create barriers that block immune cells newer post immunotherapy combination most effective as

nci staff enlarge image of a mouse tumor with immune cells red being blocked from entering the tumor by a barrier of collagen fibers grey credit used with permission from the george washington nanofabrication and imaging center scientists have identified a protein that may help prevent immune cells from entering breast tumors and killing the cancer cells the research which was conducted primarily in mice could lead to potential strategies for overcoming barriers that keep certain immune cells from attacking tumors according to the investigators the protein ddr is a cell growth protein that binds to collagen proteins which have a fiber like structure collagen proteins are a prominent part of structural support network for cells and tissues called the extracellular matrix the new findings show that in mouse models of breast cancer tumor cells released a segment of the ddr protein into the surrounding tumor microenvironment here the molecule appears to orchestrate the alignment of collagen proteins into dense barriers that block immune cells from coming into tumors the researchers reported in nature on november we have known that some cancers prevent immune cells such as t cells from infiltrating tumors but the mechanisms have not always been clear said study co leader rong li ph d of the george washington university school of medicine health sciences he studies the biology of triple negative breast cancer which is an aggressive form of the disease in the experiments which used mouse models of triple negative breast cancer the researchers found evidence that ddr promotes the alignment of collagen fibers the aligned fibers then form a barrier that keeps immune cells from penetrating into tumors the researchers also found that blocking portion of ddr shed into the extracellular matrix with an antibody drug disrupted the alignment of collagen fibers and slowed tumor growth mice treated with the antibodies also had greater numbers of immune cells in their tumors than untreated mice in mice the antibodies can increase the infiltration of immune cells into tumors said study co leader zhiqiang an ph d who directs the texas therapeutics institute at the university of texas health science center at houston and led the development of antibodies that bind to the shed portion of ddr the antibodies have been licensed to a company for development as a potential treatment he noted more research is needed to determine whether targeting ddr could be a potential therapeutic strategy for triple negative breast cancer said lillian kuo ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who was not involved in the research but dr kuo agreed with the investigators that targeting ddr could be a potential way to enable immune cells to enter the tumor microenvironment focusing on triple negative breast cancer triple negative breast cancer accounts for of breast cancers and is difficult to treat because it doesn t respond to hormone therapies or her directed therapies the relative lack of treatments for triple negative breast cancer has led researchers to explore the possibility of immunotherapy earlier this year the food and drug administration approved an immunotherapy drug in combination with chemotherapy for this breast cancer subtype overall however immunotherapy drugs have not proven to be particularly effective against triple negative breast cancer ddr which is a type of signaling protein called a receptor tyrosine kinase is overproduced in some breast tumors which suggests that it could be a potential target for treatment the researchers explained when the portion of ddr that sits outside of the cell membrane binds to another specific protein known as its ligand the kinase portion inside the cell becomes activated and can fuel cell growth some cancer therapies such as imatinib gleevec and erlotinib tarceva inhibit the activity of overly active tyrosine kinases we thought that by blocking the ddr tyrosine kinase activity we could develop a potential treatment for triple negative breast cancer said dr an but this approach did not shrink or eradicate tumors in animal models of triple negative breast cancer the researchers then began to focus on the portion of ddr outside the cell membrane known as its extracellular domain the extracellular domain can be shed from the larger protein and then circulate outside the cell the roles of collagen after more than years of studying ddr we discovered that the shed extracellular domain can bind to collagen to form a protective barrier surrounding the tumor masses and prevent killer t cells from infiltrating the tumor microenvironment said dr an in addition to the mouse studies the researchers analyzed tissue samples from patients with breast cancer the analysis revealed that higher levels of ddr in breast tumors were associated with fewer numbers of immune cells the research also highlighted the multiple roles of collagen although collagen can keep immune cells out of tumors studies have also suggested that the loss of collagen can allow tumors to grow more rapidly one would imagine that collagen maintains a line of defense against immune cells and therefore removing collagen should reduce tumor growth said dr li but just removing collagen may not help because collagen has both anti and pro tumor effects he added our approach is to disrupt the structure of collagen rather than reducing the amount of collagen in tumors the researchers are planning to investigate whether ddr plays a similar immune cell blocking role in other types of cancer they also plan to search for other proteins that might be involved in building such protective barriers around tumors this study shows that one should never give up on a project because the data do not match the initial hypothesis said dr an it is also a reminder that thinking outside of the box can lead to new discoveries older post test detects early signs of

subscribe december by nci staff mri of a medulloblastoma in the brain credit nci connect staff in up to one third of children treated for a common and fast growing type of brain tumor called medulloblastoma the tumor will come back but by the time doctors discover the cancer has returned through magnetic resonance imaging mri or a spinal tap it is often at such an advanced stage that it is difficult to treat almost all children whose cancer returns after treatment ultimately die from the disease now researchers have developed a test that detects specific changes in dna fragments or cell free dna shed from medulloblastoma tumor cells into the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord known as the cerebrospinal fluid based on their findings from a recent study the researchers believe this test could potentially be used to identify children who shortly after completing treatment still have evidence of cancer known as residual disease who are at high risk of relapse the findings appeared october in cancer cell being able to identify residual disease sooner than is possible with other methods could be very important for children with medulloblastoma the researchers who led the study believe giving doctors precious time to treat these patients with more aggressive therapy parents will tell you that once they reach the end of therapy they get incredibly nervous because they re just waiting and observing to see if their child s cancer comes back said giles w robinson m d of st jude children s research hospital one of the study s leaders if you have a test that can say you re truly free of the disease at the end of treatment that adds a huge amount of reassurance he said but if the test shows you have evidence of residual disease then maybe that shouldn t be the end of therapy in the new study researchers analyzed samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected at various points during and after treatment from children with medulloblastoma patients whose cancer came back they found were much more likely to have cell free dna with cancer related characteristics in the fluid samples than those who remained cancer free this study is groundbreaking said marta penas prado m d of the neuro oncology branch in nci s center for cancer research who was not involved with the study it opens the door to a highly sensitive method of confirming the presence of tumor cells when imaging scans or conventional spinal taps aren t conclusive dr robinson noted that more studies are needed to validate the test in additional groups of patients before we can determine how it might be used to direct treatment improving residual disease detection medulloblastoma typically forms in the cerebellum region of the brain and is very fast growing with tumors spreading to other areas of brain and spinal cord through the cerebrospinal fluid depending on the age at diagnosis and whether the disease has spread approximately of kids with medulloblastoma will survive at least years doctors currently treat medulloblastomas with surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy but in up to one third of children with medulloblastoma the cancer comes back after treatment mri scans can help doctors see when a tumor has come back but imaging cannot detect small amounts of remaining tumor cells known as measurable residual disease or minimal residual disease that can indicate that treatment has not eliminated the cancer entirely also imaging can be difficult to interpret especially in patients who have undergone previous surgeries and radiation there are things like scar tissue from surgery and from radiation that can look exactly the same as a tumor said dr penas prado as a result during the period of treatment after surgery repeated spinal taps in which a needle is inserted between vertebrae under anesthesia to collect samples of cerebrospinal fluid for analysis are typically performed to look for any cancer cells that remain the cerebrospinal fluid is currently used to identify metastatic tumor cells under the microscope said one of the study s lead researchers paul northcott ph d also of st jude but even in patients who have active disease we often fail to detect tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid it s not a very sensitive test many studies have investigated whether identifying cancer related changes in bits of genetic material in the blood or other body fluids can help to detect cancer recurrences sooner than other methods the st jude team wanted to see if this approach could be used as a marker of measurable residual disease in cerebrospinal fluid from kids with medulloblastoma what we have seen in diseases like leukemia is that if you can detect signs of residual disease really early on then you can make some treatment adjustments and actually improve the prognosis of those patients and potentially prevent relapse said dr robinson there s a lot of interest in the concept of liquid biopsy for cancer but the technology hadn t been optimized for pediatric brain tumors said dr northcott through careful scientific trial and error and optimization at the lab bench we found a protocol that can reliably identify the genomic variations characteristic of medulloblastoma genetic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid looks promising lumbar puncture a patient lies in a curled position on a table after a small area on the lower back is numbed a spinal needle a long thin needle is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid csf shown in blue the fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing credit national cancer institute in the new study the researchers analyzed available cerebrospinal fluid samples that had been collected from children ages to years who were newly diagnosed with medulloblastoma and participating in a clinical trial using a technique called low coverage whole genome sequencing they looked for cell free dna that had specific genomic changes called copy number variations that are characteristic of medulloblastoma in the samples collected from children after surgery but before the start of treatment the new test detected these tumor specific copy number variations the marker for measurable residual disease in of children with disease that spread beyond the cerebellum metastatic disease and in of children whose cancer had not spread this suggested to the researchers that this test could identify disease when it was present in small quantities however in samples collected after therapy had begun from children within months of their cancer returning measurable residual disease was found in nearly all of them out of in comparison the test did not detect any measurable residual disease in out of of cerebrospinal fluid samples from children whose cancer did not return what s more in children whose mris showed no signs of cancer after radiation therapy but whose disease eventually returned the test found measurable residual disease in half of these patients at least months and up to years earlier than imaging did we could see that the disease was starting to re emerge in that fluid well before we could see it on an mri dr robinson said this offers us an opportunity to intervene earlier than ever before spotting the return of disease this early also has scientific potential dr northcott said with further improvements in technology and as researchers gain more experience in analyzing cell free dna he continued we believe we will be able to make more molecular discoveries that can explain why the disease has not gone away still work to do before test can be used for kids with medulloblastoma dr robinson noted that it may take years before such a test is incorporated as part of standard care for children with medulloblastoma additional studies are needed to validate their results he explained however it may not be long before this test is included in future medulloblastoma clinical trials so we can better understand how to tailor therapy around detection of measurable residual disease he said dr penas prado also cautioned that this test has only been studied in children and may not apply to adults with medulloblastoma this brain cancer is now commonly grouped into four subtypes based on the cancer s genetic makeup the majority of adults have a subtype of medulloblastoma called sonic hedgehog this subtype is less common among children it turns out in this study that the tumors with the sonic hedgehog molecular subtype were less likely to shed dna into the cerebrospinal fluid she said that means this test may be less applicable for adults with medulloblastoma than for children in an accompanying editorial john r prensner m d ph d and scott l pomeroy m d ph d of the broad institute of massachusetts institute of technology and harvard university noted that analyzing cerebrospinal fluid may be less practical for patients not being treated as part of a clinical trial where cerebrospinal fluid is collected at different time points although further research is needed they continued the lessons gained from this work will inevitably catalyze important conversations

by nci staff a new risk prediction tool could help inform discussions on when to start breast cancer screening credit istock researchers have developed a new tool to estimate the risk of breast cancer in us black women the team that developed the tool hopes it will help guide more personalized decisions on when black women especially younger women should begin breast cancer screening compared with white women black women in the united states are younger at diagnosis on average and are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive or advanced forms of breast cancer they also are more likely to die from breast cancer than women of all other racial and ethnic groups these disparities or inequalities are thought to reflect the interplay of many factors from tumor biology to matters like income diet access to quality health care and other factors related to systemic and structural racism called the black women s health study breast cancer risk calculator the new tool uses information on a woman s medical reproductive and family history to estimate her chance of developing breast cancer over the next or years this information is gathered from an online questionnaire that a woman and her health care provider can complete together like other questionnaire based breast cancer risk models the new model is only moderately good at predicting whether or not an individual woman will go on to develop breast cancer the researchers cautioned but it could help guide decisions about whether black women should consider screening for breast cancer starting at age versus or even earlier than if they have very high risk said anne marie mccarthy ph d of the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania who was not involved in the research a major goal is for younger black women to have a chance to have breast cancer detected and treated at early stages so that fewer will die of the disease said julie palmer sc d of boston university school of medicine who led the effort to develop the new model published october in the journal of clinical oncology the nci funded effort builds on previous models that estimate breast cancer risk in black women in large part by including additional risk factors most existing models for calculating a woman s risk of breast cancer were developed and tested with data mainly from white women and don t work as well for black women dr palmer said but for a long time there weren t enough data out there to develop and test a robust model for predicting breast cancer in black women this tool helps address a critical gap in breast cancer risk prediction said emily conant m d chief of breast imaging at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania who was not involved with the work developing the risk calculator there is a lot of confusion about when women should be assessed for their risk of breast cancer and when they should begin screening for the disease dr conant explained existing guidelines from medical groups vary in the age at which they recommend starting screening some advise starting at age while others recommend beginning at age or all guidelines however emphasize the need for patients and their health care providers to talk through these issues known as shared decision making especially for women younger than the new risk model is intended to help inform these discussions for black women and their providers dr palmer and her colleagues explained to develop the model they used data from us black women who had participated in three large population based studies of breast cancer about half of the women in each study self identified as black the studies which compared women who developed breast cancer with those who did not collected information on risk factors such as a family history of other cancer types and whether a woman breastfed her children the team then tested the model s performance using years of health data from nearly participants in the black women s health study an ongoing study co led by dr palmer overall the ability of the new model to predict the likelihood that an individual black woman would develop breast cancer was similar to that of the most commonly used models for predicting breast cancer risk in white women the new model performed best for black women under age and these younger women are most in need of a personalized tool to guide decisions about screening dr palmer said in addition to estimating an individual woman s and year risk of developing breast cancer the online risk calculator provides information on the average risk for us black women of the same age women with a family history of breast cancer are especially concerned about risk and this model could be used to help put their risk in context said ruth pfeiffer ph d a risk prediction expert in nci s division of cancer epidemiology and genetics dceg who helped develop the new model the model could also be used to identify black women who are eligible to participate in studies of ways to prevent breast cancer in women at very high risk of the disease dr palmer said when these studies are launched we want to make sure that good tools to identify potential participants of all races and ethnicities are available to researchers developing those studies so that those most likely to benefit have a fair chance to be included she explained in addition dr palmer and her colleagues wrote the model could guide decisions on whether to refer some black women for genetic testing that looks for inherited changes known to increase the risk of breast cancer room for improvement unfortunately many primary care doctors don t use questionnaires that predict breast cancer risk because they have so many demands on their time dr palmer said but breast cancer is life changing for young women who get the disease and many young black women are diagnosed with and die from it before they reach the ages at which screening is typically recommended she continued we re hoping that primary care practices will start using the new tool to identify those who might benefit from earlier screening in the future dr mccarthy said an online version of a questionnaire such as the one used in the new study might be built into an electronic health record then to save time a woman could fill out the questionnaire online before her appointment and the doctor could easily review the results in her record we still have a long road ahead to develop better models for all women dr pfeiffer said right now the big hope for improving risk prediction is to incorporate information on genetic markers that are associated with increased risk along those lines dceg is conducting the confluence project in collaboration with multiple breast cancer consortia to analyze genomic data from women with breast cancer and without including women of different races and ethnicities a parallel effort is the nci funded breast cancer genetic study in african ancestry populations data from the two studies will be used to develop and validate risk scores based on inherited genetic changes that can then be integrated into this model as well as into future models that will be developed through a more recent nci funded project risk models could also be improved by including information on the amount of dense breast tissue an individual woman has which is a known risk factor for breast cancer dr conant said however that would require having at least one previous mammogram achieving equity in breast cancer dr palmer and others agree that screening is just one part of addressing disparities in breast cancer patient navigation programs as well as cultural competency training for providers can lead to more equitable access to optimal cancer care for black women a major factor in mortality disparities she said other researchers are also using modeling to help develop more equitable care a recent study used computer models to try to identify equitable screening mammography strategies for black women in the united states the findings suggest that screening black women with mammograms every years starting at age is the best strategy for reducing disparities in breast cancer deaths but ideally researchers agreed decisions on when to start screening should be made on a more individual basis rather than based only on someone s age dr pfeiffer noted that two large ongoing studies are comparing the effectiveness of breast cancer screening based on current guidelines versus a woman s individual risk they are the women informed to screen depending on measures of risk wisdom study in the united states which is funded in part by nci and the international my personalized breast screening study this new model is one step toward personalized cancer prevention which includes detecting disease early to improve health outcomes dr pfeiffer said we talk about tailoring cancer treatment but we should tailor prevention too older

november by nci staff some people treated with radiation therapy after surgery for prostate cancer can receive a shorter more intensive course without an increase in long term side effects a new study shows credit national cancer institute many people with prostate cancer can safely receive a shorter more intensive course of radiation therapy after surgery than has conventionally been used a new study has found in a large clinical trial people who received the shorter course of treatment which lasted for weeks reported more bowel problems immediately following treatment than those who underwent the standard weeks of less intensive radiation however by months after treatment both groups reported similar levels of bowel problems and an overall equivalent quality of life the study relied on patients reporting the side effects related to treatment and their overall well being known as patient reported outcomes physician reported toxicities can sometimes lead us astray said mark buyyounouski m d a radiation oncologist at stanford university who led the trial not everything that can be counted by us counts to patients so we wanted to know when do people tell us that they re feeling good again the results of the study which was run by the nci funded clinical cooperative group nrg oncology were presented on october at the american society for radiation oncology annual meeting even though the use of higher radiation doses over a shorter period called hypofractionated postoperative prostate bed radiotherapy or hyport did have more side effects in the near term many people are likely to consider that a worthwhile tradeoff for fewer weeks of treatment said deborah citrin m d of nci s center for cancer research who was not involved in the study for a lot of patients coming in every weekday for weeks has a major impact on their lives she said there s a lot of interest in hypofractionation because getting treatment done more quickly is so much easier financially and otherwise a large role for radiation therapy people diagnosed with localized prostate cancer that is disease that hasn t spread outside the prostate region have many potential treatment options depending on the stage and grade potential aggressiveness of the tumor some may have surgery alone others may only have radiation therapy and some may have a combination of the two this often happens when there s concern that surgery hadn t removed all the tumor tissue or if someone s prostate specific antigen psa levels start to rise months or years after surgery radiation therapy may be recommended even if imaging hasn t been able to identify tumor growth hypofractionated radiation therapy is already an accepted treatment option for some people undergoing radiation therapy alone to treat prostate cancer but whether this type of radiation therapy is appropriate for use after surgery has been unclear when radiation is used after surgery it s delivered to a larger area of the body including sensitive areas in the bladder and rectum dr buyyounouski explained this raises the possibility that the higher doses used in hypofractionation may cause long term side effects that could outweigh the benefit of two fewer weeks of treatment for these patients and a lot of people do have some urinary complications after surgery said dr citrin so even a small increase in urinary or bowel symptoms that persist after treatment with one treatment regimen versus the other could be quite impactful in terms of quality of life to test whether hypofractionation affected these patients quality of life differently than conventional fractionation the nrg oncology researchers enrolled almost participants from more than treatment centers across the country into the trial an inclusive clinical trial the team designed the phase trial to be as inclusive as possible to capture a population that looks like people commonly treated in the community dr buyyounouski explained the participants included both people getting radiation immediately after surgery and those who waited until they had rising psa levels participants who had some invasion of their cancer into nearby tissue were eligible although those whose cancer had spread to their lymph nodes were excluded they could also receive up to months of androgen deprivation therapy a type of hormone therapy if recommended by their doctor participants were randomly assigned to treatment with hyport consisting of a higher dose or fraction of radiation every weekday for weeks or the commonly used lower dose every weekday for weeks they were asked about urinary and bowel symptoms before radiation and and months after treatment using the expanded prostate cancer index composite epic questionnaire after prostate cancer treatments common urinary symptoms can include urine leakage or pain or burning when urinating common bowel symptoms can include bowel leakage or urgency the trial did not measure sexual side effects such as erectile dysfunction since these can also be affected by hormone therapy about three quarters of the participants completed all questionnaires at the end of treatment people who received hyport reported more bowel side effects although urinary side effects were equivalent between groups by months after treatment this difference in bowel symptoms had disappeared and people in both groups reported equivalent quality of life for both bowel and urinary symptoms the groups continued to report similar and relatively low levels of symptoms for up to years after finishing treatment no differences in cancer recurrence were seen between the two groups the nrg oncology team will continue to track recurrences over time but do not expect to see any difference emerge dr buyyounouski said the two groups received the same overall radiation dose and other trials of hypofractionation compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy in people with similar forms of prostate cancer who did not have surgery have not shown differences in recurrence or survival that s why in a situation where the disease control outcomes are likely to be similar what really matters to a patient is how am i going to feel dr citrin said helping people imagine their future the hardest thing we can do as physicians is help patients envision their future selves dr buyyounouski said so patient reported outcomes are very helpful because you can tell other patients exactly what side effects people had and the frequency and bother of those side effects at different points in time for many he added the trade off in more side effects right after treatment will be worth it for a shorter treatment duration unless you ve been a patient it s hard for folks to imagine all the things that need to happen for somebody to go and get treatment every weekday for weeks dr buyyounouski said there s transportation costs gas parking co pays and there are costs associated with the things you re not doing like time away from work or responsibilities at home it s more than just the medical bills i think people are itching to shorten the treatment duration because there are a lot of patients for whom it s a barrier to getting treatment and radiation therapy is a potentially curative treatment added dr citrin so making it easier for patients without increasing the long term side effects is a huge win however a less intensive standard course of radiation will still likely appeal to some people she added especially if they are experiencing ongoing side effects from surgery the results of the current study also aren t immediately applicable to everyone having radiation therapy after prostate cancer surgery for example the study didn t include people who needed radiation to their lymph nodes the results can t explicitly provide guidance on the impact of hypofractionation on quality of life for these patients dr citrin explained but for people who have tumors similar to those treated in the current trial the machines and expertise used for this type of radiation can be commonly found across the country dr buyyounouski explained so we want people to know that this is available near you he said the only caveat for someone looking to receive hyport is that the trial used image guidance for all patients this procedure uses technologies like ct or ultrasound to help clinicians guide where the radiation therapy is delivered that s something to make sure your local provider is using he added several ongoing clinical trials are looking at whether prostate radiation therapy can be compressed any further for select patients dr citrin added for example her group is currently running a clinical trial testing hypofractionated radiation delivered over the course of to weeks recent advances in prostate imaging may also allow for more personalized radiation therapy which could potentially help reduce side effects said dr citrin for example the food and drug administration recently approved psma based pet ct imaging to look for tiny cancer deposits in the prostate or elsewhere in the body this may allow oncologists to target smaller areas of tissue more effectively or to avoid radiation treatment in patients who are unlikely to benefit from it ongoing research in radiation oncology is often aimed at making radiation therapy more convenient less toxic and less expensive for patients while maintaining excellent cure rates dr citrin said older post tecartus becomes first car t cell therapy approved for adults with all newer post

by nci staff a group of killer t cells green and red surrounding a cancer cell blue credit national institutes of health adults with the most common form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia all a type of blood cancer often respond to initial treatments only to have the disease return while others cancers don t respond at all to treatment now these patients may have another treatment option a type of immunotherapy called car t cell therapy on october the food and drug administration fda approved the use of the car t cell therapy brexucabtagene autoleucel tecartus for adults with b cell precursor all that has not responded to treatment refractory or has returned after treatment relapsed the approval makes brexucabtagene the first car t cell therapy approved for adults with all the approval was based on results of a small phase clinical trial called zuma that included more than adults with relapsed or refractory b cell precursor all who were treated with brexucabtagene within months of receiving the treatment more than half of the participants had no signs of cancer complete remission and for many of the patients that response lasted for more than a year we haven t seen responses and durations of responses like this said the trial s lead investigator bijal shah m d m s of moffit cancer center this is the second fda approval for brexucabtagene in august it was approved to treat some adults with mantle cell lymphoma consistent with previous studies of brexucabtagene most participants experienced side effects including high rates of a serious inflammatory condition called cytokine release syndrome or crs and neurological problems two participants died as a result of an adverse reaction to the treatment while the side effects are often severe they don t outweigh the potential benefits of brexucabtagene dr shah said we are going to see these syndromes but for most patients they are going to be reversible they re going to get better and they have potential remission on the other side a new approach to treating a stubborn leukemia as its name indicates b cell all originates in white blood cells called b cells it occurs most commonly in children but can also affect adults over the past decades researchers have been able to greatly improve how long children with b cell all live in large part by modifying and improving the chemotherapy regimens they receive using some of those same regimens we ve seen outcomes improve for adolescents and young adults up to age with b cell all said shira dinner m d of northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine who was not involved in the zuma trial but similar gains haven t been seen for older people with b cell all she added for adults and older the prognosis has still been poor while adults with b cell all may respond to other drugs including blinatumomab blincyto and inotuzumab ozogamicin besponsa the cancer often returns the median overall survival after treatment with either drug is less than months even though outcomes have improved with these new treatment options dr dinner noted that some of the limitations of those treatments as well as of more traditional chemotherapies is that the duration of remission is still very short when the cancer does return after treatment with these drugs the next step is often a stem cell transplant but this procedure is not an option for many patients some have already had a transplant or don t have a donor available or are just not fit to have a transplant due to their age or other medical problems said dr dinner for patients who don t have the option of a stem cell transplant brexucabtagene could be a good alternative dr dinner continued brexucabtagene was associated with promising survival outcomes more than half of patients in the zuma trial whose tumors responded to the treatment were still alive months later with median survival not reached i can t say yet that brexucabtagene is a replacement for a stem cell transplant but for duration of response and survival outcomes to date it is the most promising of the treatments that we have available dr dinner noted results from the zuma trial enlarge car t cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient s t cells a type of immune cell are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them credit national cancer institute like other fda approved car t cell therapies brexucabtagene begins with a patient s own t cells these immune cells are collected and then modified to produce a special receptor on their surface through a complex manufacturing process this receptor allows the t cells to better target and kill cancer cells of the patients who initially enrolled in the trial car t cells were successfully manufactured for all but the median time between t cell collection via a procedure known as leukapheresis and the production of car t cells was days for patients in the united states and days for patients in europe before being infused with brexucabtagene all participants underwent conditioning chemotherapy according to kite which manufactures brexucabtagene and funded the zuma trial at a median follow up of approximately months of patients had a complete remission following treatment or a complete remission without their white blood cell counts returning to normal of those who had a complete remission kite reported more than half continued to have no signs of cancer for at least a year this does not necessarily mean that these patients are completely cured dr dinner cautioned we will need longer term follow up data on these patients to determine whether the cancer could return she noted dr shah is optimistic following brexucabtagene treatment and a stem cell transplant he said there s a real chance that you could carry that patient forward to a cure and for those who can t undergo a transplant they re still really good odds certainly higher than we ve ever achieved in this setting nearly every patient experienced side effects after receiving brexucabtagene crs which can cause intense fever and other flu like symptoms occurred in of people treated with brexucabtagene with of patients experiencing severe crs and of participants experienced neurological side effects including tremor confusional state and encephalopathy for of patients the neurological side effects were severe when these symptoms do happen it could be very hard for an older adult to tolerate them dr dinner said so i do think side effects are an important factor that a physician needs to be considering when discussing the risks and benefits of brexucabtagene with a patient what lies ahead for brexucabtagene although the results from this trial are promising said dr dinner more research is needed to understand how the therapy will fit into existing treatment strategies we have to be mindful of the fact that car t cell therapy is a complicated new technology dr dinner said for example hospitals and clinicians are still learning how to deal with the logistical hurdles presented by these treatments nonetheless she added this is a big step forward based on these encouraging results in people with refractory or relapsed b cell all car t cell therapy could be investigated as an initial or first line treatment for some patients according to dr shah that could include those whose cancer is determined to be at particularly high risk of not responding well to existing first line treatments there are also potential uses for brexucabtagene or other car t cell therapies in other patients with all this approval is only for b cell precursor all dr dinner said so there are still gaps for t cell all which makes up of the all population there are some car t cell treatments that are in development for that disease older post new on nci s websites for november newer post shorter more intensive radiation safe after surgery for prostate cancer recommended from nci nci aims to boost car

staff enlarge an interactome of protein protein interactions detected in two head and neck cancer cell lines and one normal cell line credit from science october doi science abf reprinted with permission from aaas proteins are often called the workhorses of cells the machinery that makes cells go they act as key players in the many chemical reactions constantly occurring in cells collect cellular garbage provide structure repair damaged dna and much more but individual proteins rarely act on their own instead like molecular lego bricks they join together with other proteins in precise configurations to carry out their duties now a team of researchers has used advanced technologies and computational techniques to identify the interactions among proteins that commonly form in head and neck and breast cancer cells they also created a map of how the interacting proteins also called protein complexes function in key communication networks or pathways in those cells three studies describing the initial fruits of this work were published september in science in one of the studies mapping protein protein interactions in this fashion allowed them to identify a potentially effective treatment for people with head and neck cancers whose tumors have specific mutations in a gene called pik ca but unlike most targeted therapies the drug doesn t block the altered pik ca proteins in cancer cells that have mutations in the pik ca gene rather the drug blocks the action of a different protein in the cell called her the pathway map the team created revealed a strong interaction between the mutated pik ca proteins which are part of a larger protein complex called pi k and her proteins disrupting her the researchers showed provides a backdoor way of targeting the cancer promoting actions of mutant pik ca this discovery and important findings from the other two studies provide some of the first true demonstrations of the potential of systematically mapping protein communication pathways in cancer cells said one of the study leaders nevan krogan ph d director of the quantitative biosciences institute at the university of california san francisco ucsf the effort builds on the many studies that have mapped cancer genomes while also addressing some of the shortcomings of gene centric approaches to studying the biology of cancer dr krogan said we need an approach that addresses the complexity of cancer so we have to go to that next step he explained that next step is the functional unit of the cell proteins the studies are part of a larger nci supported research initiative by researchers at ucsf and the university of california san diego ucsd to comprehensively map protein networks in cancer cells the researchers believe these maps will open up new avenues for understanding and treating cancer at its core the mapping effort is intended to provide a higher level view of cancer processes said shannon hughes ph d of nci s division of cancer biology it s not just focusing on one gene or one protein but how genes and proteins act in a system this line of research can provide important new insights into the biology of cancer but also has the potential to impact cancer care dr hughes explained it broadens the potential targets for treatment she said and by taking that broader view you can identify more patients who might be candidates for those treatments from genetic mutations to pathways people with cancer are increasingly treated based on the genetic alterations present in their tumors for example several drugs are approved to treat patients with breast cancer and leukemia whose cancers have mutations in genes that provide the blueprints for the proteins that are part of the pi k complex an ever expanding collection of targeted cancer therapies block the actions of proteins produced as a result of mutations in genes like egfr her braf and many others but with a few exceptions most of these treatments only work in a modest portion of patients whose tumors express that target or if they do initially shrink or stabilize tumors in many cases the cancers become resistant to the treatment and begin growing again researchers believe one reason these treatments don t work or stop working is that specific alterations in cancer related genes even those that studies have shown are major drivers of a specific cancer don t represent the complete picture of how those mutations affect a cell s protein machinery explained the studies co leader trey ideker ph d a professor in the ucsd departments of medicine bioengineering and computer science although it has had tremendous value the more traditional gene centric approach to studying cancer is like looking at the nuts and bolts in a car engine dr ideker said we ve now got to look at the cell s bigger machines the groundwork for this bigger picture approach has already been laid wrote ran chang ph d and peter jackson ph d of the stanford university school of medicine in an editorial in science that accompanied the three studies for many cancers there is an extensive catalog of genetic mutations they wrote but a consolidated map that organizes these mutations into pathways that drive tumor growth is missing with funding from nci s cancer systems biology consortium that consolidated map is precisely what the ucsf and ucsd researchers are hoping to help create with their cancer cell map initiative a linchpin of their research is a technology known as affinity purification mass spectrometry which they use to identify protein protein interactions that include known cancer related proteins in meticulous fashion the researchers systematically analyze mutations in genes and their impact on protein protein interactions in cells and use advanced computational methods to parse the resulting data and generate the network maps these maps dr hughes said get us close to knowing what s happening in a cell at any given time other studies have created network maps dr krogan noted but they have been much more limited in scope nobody has done it to this scale he stressed integrating genomics proteomics and biochemistry with the mass spectrometry analyses and advanced computational tools he added makes this a flagship set of studies in my opinion mutated collagen proteins may aid cancer metastasis another of the ucsf ucsd studies focused on identifying protein protein interactions in breast cancer while the third study combined findings from the first two to provide a more universal analysis of cancer wide pathways among the key findings of the latter study was the discovery of recurrent mutations in proteins that are part of collagen a main component of the extracellular matrix or ecm the ecm provides a scaffold for collections of cells in the body including tumors the recurrent mutations in these collagen complexes the researchers wrote disrupt ed the extracellular matrix in tumors thereby promoting proliferation of cancer cells in mice they reported when these same mutated collagen proteins were present tumors were more likely to spread in the body a cozy relationship with her in the head and neck cancer study the researchers first identified genes that previous studies have shown are commonly mutated in the most common form of head and neck cancers called squamous cell carcinoma they focused particular attention on pik ca because it s the most commonly mutated gene in this type of head and neck cancer they analyzed two cell lines of head and neck cancer and a cell line made from healthy cells from the upper esophagus in all they identified protein protein interactions linked to these cancer related genes in the head and neck cancer cells and healthy cells nearly of the interactions had never been reported in cancer cells with the most commonly mutated form of pik ca the resulting pik ca proteins preferentially interacted with her they reported like her which is the target of several drugs now commonly used to treat breast cancer her is a receptor that straddles the cell s surface and interacts with molecules both inside and outside the cell a tight bond between her and pik ca was not found in cells with normal pik ca protein or with different mutant forms of pik ca when the researchers tested an experimental her blocking drug in mice injected with head and neck cancer cells with that specific pi kca mutation no tumors grew when they used cells with a different pi kca mutation the her blocking drug had no effect on tumor growth it would have been extremely difficult to make this discovery using more traditional approaches dr krogan said it s only when you do this type of analysis systematically and quantitatively that you re able to see this interaction between these two proteins he said pushing ahead on pathways based on previous studies implicating her in head and neck cancers positive for the human papillomavirus hpv the her inhibitor used in the head and neck study is already being tested in small clinical trials of patients with these cancers but the study team believes these new findings may help identify people whose tumors are most likely to shrink following her inhibitor treatment there s a strong interest among researchers to target the particular axis of her and pik ca interactions dr krogan said approximately of all cancers have the specific pik ca mutation shown in the study to be susceptible to blocking her he said so it s not just head and neck cancer it s many others he said from a broader perspective continued research is needed to further improve functional maps and more precisely define which protein protein interactions are rewired in each tumor drs chang and jackson wrote in their commentary that will entail expanding the research scope they stressed when proteins interact with each other the resulting complexes are not static structures but rather dynamically reassemble in response to the state of the cell they explained so it will be helpful to understand the impact on these interactions of other factors that can affect cells they wrote such as things happening in and around the tumor known as its microenvironment including inflammation and the presence of different types of immune cells dr hughes agreed that these first studies are just the beginning in the longer term she anticipates that the development of tests that identify specific interactions in patients tumor samples would be difficult rather she continued we ll use the maps constructed through these types of studies to direct treatment by interpreting the genomic data on tumors already being collected in the meantime dr ideker said that he s optimistic that their work will encourage other groups to use this approach to mapping network pathways and make it systematic for the whole of cancer cell biology older post does too much fructose help colorectal cancers grow newer post new on nci s websites

contracts careers visitor information search search home news events cancer currents blog cancer currents blog does too much fructose help colorectal cancers grow subscribe october by nci staff a microscopic cross section of villi finger like structures that line the intestines credit used with permission from amy engevik ph d medical university of south carolina a new study suggests that excess consumption of fructose can promote both obesity and colorectal cancer conducted largely in mice the study found that large amounts of the sweetener which is present in both table sugar and high fructose corn syrup hfcs increased how long both normal and cancer cells in the intestines live in normal mice this increased cell survival led to more nutrients being absorbed leading to weight gain and in mice prone to develop cancer the increased cell survival led the animals to develop larger tumors and more anemia a common tumor related complication findings from the study which was funded in part by nci appeared august in nature the researchers led by marcus goncalves m d ph d of weill cornell medicine are launching human studies to see if a similar phenomenon occurs in people but this mouse study is really important because it establishes a molecular mechanism for why fructose can drive tumor growth said kristine willis ph d of nci s division of cancer biology who was not involved with the study how could fructose increase tumor growth in dr goncalves and his colleagues published a study showing that feeding hfcs to mice prone to developing intestinal tumors could increase the size and aggressiveness of colorectal tumors they also found that blocking the uptake of that particular sweetener by the body s cells could prevent such growth but the details of the why behind these results remained a mystery in the new work the researchers thoroughly examined what was happening on the cellular level in the intestines after hfcs consumption they first looked at what happened to intestinal cells in normal mice fed a diet including large amounts of hfcs the team focused on villi finger like protrusions of the intestinal lining villi increase the surface area of the intestinal lining and maximize the amount of nutrients that can be absorbed after a meal the hfcs caused the villi to grow in length normal mice fed hfcs had villi that were around longer than those in mice that weren t fed the sweetener when the mice were then fed a high fat diet in addition to excess fructose it caused them to gain far more weight than mice only fed a high fat diet high fructose corn syrup metabolism at the cellular level further experiments showed that the overabundance of hfcs kept the cells at the tips of the villi alive longer normally the cells at the tip of a villus where oxygen levels are lower called hypoxia die off they re then replaced by new cells that are produced at the base of the villus and migrate up to the tip but by increasing cell survival at the villi tips and with new cells continuing to be made the villi inevitably got longer they found enlarge excess fructose causes cells at the tips of villi to live longer than they should with new cells continuing to be made the villi get longer credit used with permission from dr marcus goncalves weill cornell medicine the researchers then turned to human colorectal cancer cell lines to see whether excess fructose would affect their ability to grow and survive in low oxygen conditions hypoxia is a common occurrence in the middle of tumors and can limit their growth as with the mouse intestinal cells the researchers found that adding fructose to colorectal cancer cells grown in a low oxygen environment didn t increase the rate at which they grew but helped the cells survive longer than cells to which fructose wasn t added but why does fructose increase cell survival when oxygen levels are low in further experiments in colorectal cancer cells the researchers found that the sweetener caused a chain of cellular reactions which resulted in lowered activity of a protein called pkm pkm is involved in cellular metabolism when pkm activity is low as can happen under stressful conditions like hypoxia cells adjust their metabolism so that they can stay alive so in order to survive the tumor wants to find the best way it can to inhibit pkm explained dr goncalves several additional experiments showed that preventing fructose from inhibiting pkm could stop both villi and colorectal cancer cells from thriving in a low oxygen environment for example when they gave hfcs fed normal mice a drug called tepp which turns pkm back on their villi didn t elongate and they didn t gain weight when the researchers then fed excess hfcs to mice predisposed to develop colorectal cancer the mice developed bigger tumors and became more anemic a complication associated with worse survival in both mice and people than mice not fed the sweetener treating mice fed large amounts of hfcs with tepp slowed tumor growth the ability of a drug to activate pkm even in the presence of fructose both stopping weight gain and slowing tumor growth stimulated by hfcs is exciting said dr willis there s huge potential there she said if this translates to humans does that then represent a possible avenue of treatment for obesity as well as colorectal cancer what happens in humans dr goncalves and his colleagues are getting ready to launch a follow up study in people to date it remains controversial whether substantial amounts of the hfcs that people consume in their diets can reach the colon or whether most of it gets absorbed higher in the digestive tract he explained the mouse digestive tract is much shorter than the human version relative to size making it easy for hfcs to reach the colon in mice the team will recruit people with colon cancer scheduled to undergo surgery to have their tumors removed before surgery they ll eat a meal containing hfcs to which a heavy isotope of fructose has been attached after the tumors are removed this label will allow the researchers to measure how much of the fructose made it into the cancer cells this work will the team hopes help answer the question of whether fructose from hfcs can reach tumors in the human colon if so dr goncalves said the next step is how do we intervene he added several drugs that target pkm or related molecules are currently under development for other conditions these could potentially be repurposed to reduce or shorten villi and hopefully prevent tumor growth he said metabolism can differ vastly from one person to another dr goncalves explained so many mechanisms not just related to pkm likely drive both obesity and colorectal cancer but exposure to fructose is one component of the diet that s modifiable and we think plays a role he said there s still a lot more work to do in terms of understanding how big of an effect it has and if we can use drugs to try to prevent it from happening his lab also studies cachexia a loss of body weight and muscle mass that often occurs in people with advanced cancer people with cachexia have the reverse problem from that seen in this study their villi shrink dr goncalves explained that leads to the intriguing question of whether fructose could actually be a treatment for cachexia to help people maintain weight and strength they ve started studying this approach in mice if you give cachexic animals fructose will they absorb nutrients better and ultimately maintain their body weight he asked sugar versus high fructose corn syrup what people normally refer to as sugar the table sugar used for cooking and baking is a molecule called sucrose each molecule of sucrose is composed of two smaller sugar molecules called glucose and fructose to human taste buds fructose is much sweeter than sucrose fructose is found naturally in fruit and many other foods it s also a major component of high fructose corn syrup or hfcs an inexpensive sweetener used in many processed foods and beverages to produce hfcs some of the glucose in regular corn syrup is chemically converted into fructose which can make hfcs very sweet research to date has not shown a nutritional difference between table sugar and hfcs but studies are ongoing to understand whether the way they re metabolized broken down by the body may have different effects on health the effects of fructose on the villi observed in the current studies were likely highly beneficial for animals in the wild and was for humans in the past dr goncalves explained when we didn t have agriculture and transport systems we would get our local fruit supply only in a limited fashion and elongation of the villi would help us to gain weight for the long winter coming up when food may be harder to get he said but now that we have continuous access to sugar all year long our villi are constantly long and we re constantly hyper absorbing nutrients and that may underlie why people are gaining so much weight all the time he added researchers are just starting to scratch the surface of how sugar metabolism affects cancer risk growth and treatment dr willis explained dietary guidelines universally recommend avoiding large amounts of added sugar in the diet especially sugary drinks but hfcs is almost impossible to avoid entirely in the modern world she added however a small amount is unlikely to cause long term problems and people shouldn t panic dr willis explained if you have a slice of sandwich bread you re not doomed to get cancer she said and whole unprocessed fruit a natural source of fructose remains a healthy part of any diet added dr willis that s because the amount of fructose consumed in fruit is lower than that in food containing hfcs fruit also contains healthy substances like fiber an apple is a completely different thing from a liter of soda she said older post adjuvant immunotherapy approved for some patients with lung cancer newer post

nci staff enlarge atezolizumab tecentriq is approved as an additional treatment for some patients with stage ii to iiia pictured non small cell lung cancer credit national cancer institute the food and drug administration fda has approved the immunotherapy drug atezolizumab tecentriq as an additional or adjuvant treatment after surgery and chemotherapy for some patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc the approval marks the first time an immunotherapy has been cleared as an adjuvant treatment for people with lung cancer under the october approval patients must have stage ii to iiia nsclc which means that their cancer has only spread locally that is nearby to the tumor in addition their tumors have to express the protein pd l on or more of their tumor cells which must be determined by an fda approved test fda also approved a companion diagnostic test called ventana pd l ap to identify patients who are candidates for adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab the approval is based on results from the impower clinical trial which included more than patients with nsclc who had had their tumors removed surgically the patients all received adjuvant chemotherapy before being randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab or best supportive care the group that received adjuvant atezolizumab lived about months longer without dying experiencing a recurrence of their cancer or developing a new lung cancer disease free survival than the group that received supportive care the improvement was more pronounced among patients whose tumors had elevated levels of pd l researchers reported in the lancet on september pd l is the most widely used biomarker to guide the use of immunotherapy drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors including atezolizumab treatment with atezolizumab after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy offers a promising treatment option for some patients with early stage nsclc the study authors wrote this is the first phase clinical trial to demonstrate a benefit from immunotherapy for patients with early stage nsclc said enriqueta felip m d ph d of the vall d hebron university hospital in barcelona who led the study hoffman laroche the maker of atezolizumab sponsored the trial this well done study clearly demonstrates the value of adjuvant immunotherapy when given after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early stage lung cancer said fred hirsch m d ph d executive director of the center for thoracic oncology at the tisch cancer institute at mount sinai in an interview before the fda approval was announced dr hirsch who was not involved in the research added my strong opinion is that the findings will lead to a change in clinical practice quickly an important step forward for lung cancer patients receive adjuvant treatments to reduce the risk of cancer coming back after primary treatment such as surgery adjuvant treatments may include chemotherapy radiation therapy hormone therapy and targeted therapy many patients with early stage nsclc for example receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery in many patients however the cancer eventually comes back impower is just one of several phase clinical trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors as adjuvant treatments for nsclc following surgery the nci sponsored alchemist trial also called anvil is evaluating adjuvant nivolumab opdivo and the pearls study is testing pembrolizumab keytruda as the first of these trials to report results the impower study is an important step forward justin gainor m d of massachusetts general hospital wrote in an accompanying editorial in the lancet that appeared before the fda approval was announced atezolizumab and several other immune checkpoint inhibitors are already approved as initial treatments for people with metastatic nsclc results of the impower trial impower trial participants had lung cancers ranging from stage ib through iiia however the data reported in the lancet which formed the basis for the fda approval focused mainly on those with stage ii through iiia disease specifically in these patients the tumors have only spread locally and not metastasized to distant locations in the body in stage iiia for example the cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the primary or original tumor most patients in the trial received standard adjuvant chemotherapy as planned those assigned to the atezolizumab group then went on to receive it every weeks for up to a year after a median follow up of nearly years more participants in the atezolizumab group than the best supportive care group were alive without any evidence of their cancer returning or of a new primary nsclc developing the improvement in year disease free survival with immunotherapy was even greater when looking at just those patients whose tumors expressed pd l on or more of tumor cells that s consistent with many other studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors which have shown that patients with advanced cancer whose tumor cells express pd l tend to benefit more from the treatment than patients whose tumor cells don t express it when all patients with phase ii iiia disease were considered together regardless of pd l expression level the median disease free survival was months for the patients in the atezolizumab group and months for the supportive care group a reduction in risk of a disease free survival event i e return of their cancer or discovery of a new primary lung cancer three year disease free survival rate all patients pd l on of tumor cells atezolizumab group supportive care group for those patients whose tumors expressed pd l on or more of tumor cells slightly more than half of the patients in the study overall the median disease free survival was months in the supportive care group but because too few patients had experienced a worsening of their cancer has not yet been reached in the atezolizumab group that translates to a reduction in the risk of a disease free survival event the researchers also looked specifically at patients whose tumors expressed pd l on at least of tumor cells and found that the benefit of atezolizumab was greatest in such patients among this group people in the atezolizumab group were almost less likely to experience a disease free survival event longer follow up will be needed to show if the use of adjuvant atezolizumab following adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery for lung cancer helps patients to live longer the researchers wrote the trial did not uncover any previously unknown side effects of atezolizumab the most common atezolizumab related side effects included hypothyroidism itchy skin and rash overall more side effects were reported in the atezolizumab group than in the other group approximately of patients in atezolizumab group stopped taking the drug because of side effects and patients died due to the treatment the researchers reported a new idea that could be here to stay adjuvant atezolizumab should become a new standard treatment for the appropriate patients with nsclc dr gainor wrote in his editorial a limitation of the impower trial he noted was that the researchers could not yet determine whether adjuvant atezolizumab helped patients live longer than patients who did not receive the treatment nonetheless he continued other studies of patients with nsclc have suggested that prolonging the control of the disease might be clinically meaningful this knowledge together with the results of impower supports use of adjuvant atezolizumab in the appropriate patients with nsclc he concluded stephen liu m d director of thoracic oncology at georgetown lombardi comprehensive cancer center agreed writing last month on twitter that the study results were practice changing dr liu stressed however that more work is needed to clarify which patients are likely to benefit most from adjuvant immunotherapy the available data dr hirsch noted suggest that patients whose tumors express high levels of pd l may benefit the most the impower trial paves the way for the use of immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting for treatment of lung cancer he

staff credit national cancer institute despite more than years of consistent evidence that hpv vaccines are safe and effective a new study has found that more parents are citing concerns about the vaccines safety in recent years the findings highlight an urgent need for doctors and public health leaders to address these concerns with parents according to the scientists who led the study the hpv vaccine protects against six different kinds of cancer cervical anal back of the throat penile vaginal and vulvar that are caused by infection with the human papillomavirus or hpv the vaccine is recommended for girls and boys aged or although vaccination rates have been rising since the first hpv vaccine was approved by the food and drug administration fda in only of to year olds were fully vaccinated in some parents have always cited concerns about safety for declining to get the hpv vaccine for their kids but from to the study showed the percentage of parents who declined the hpv vaccine for their kids due to safety concerns nearly doubled during the same time frame reports of serious health issues after hpv vaccination were consistently rare the study found results from the study were published september in jama network open it was really shocking to me to see this parallel analysis of parental perceptions and statements about safety and the actual safety results and they re going in opposite directions said robin vanderpool dr p h chief of nci s health communication and informatics research branch who wasn t involved in the study i think it s really telling our suspicion is that the rising safety concerns are probably being driven by the use of social media and people trying to find vaccine information online said the study s lead researcher kalyani sonawane ph d of uthealth school of public health in houston texas the study looked at data from to dr vanderpool noted well before the covid pandemic and rising hesitancy around covid vaccines my worry is that you re going to have a synergy or convergence and hpv vaccine hesitancy might get worse she said the public health and cancer control communities should be thinking about how to address this potential outcome through both health communication research and public health practice dr vanderpool added fewer health issues after vaccination to look at trends in health issues reported after hpv vaccination the researchers turned to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers a website operated by cdc and fda patients caregivers health care professionals and vaccine manufacturers can use vaers to voluntarily report any health problems that occur after vaccination from to reports of health issues following hpv vaccination went down overall reports of serious health issues after hpv vaccination were consistently rare around per hpv vaccine doses or a total of serious health problems that arose after hpv vaccination were reported in vaers during that time meanwhile the rate of nonserious health issues following hpv vaccination reported in vaers dropped from to per vaccine doses just because a health problem is reported in vaers doesn t mean the vaccine caused it dr sonawane cautioned some health reports were hearsay and lacked sufficient information to be verified she added we have to be cautious about interpreting vaers data and not make any cause effect associations she said according to cdc and fda vaers data can only be used to find unusual patterns that should be evaluated in additional studies another cdc funded vaccine safety program the vaccine safety datalink vsd also performs vaccine safety studies including those based on reports to vaers a recent vsd study of the valent hpv vaccine gardasil for example tracked new vaccinations over a year period and identified no new safety issues more parents citing safety concerns the researchers also looked at results from a large cdc led survey of parents of teens aged to from to more than caregivers of teens who had not received the hpv vaccine responded to the survey and selected of reasons for declining the vaccine the top five selected reasons were safety concerns not recommended lack of knowledge not sexually active not needed or not necessary in of parents had cited safety concerns as the main reason for declining the hpv vaccine but by that percentage had risen to during the same period there was a drop in the percentage of parents citing three of the other most common reasons for declining or delaying the hpv vaccine hpv vaccine side effects hpv vaccines can cause pain swelling and redness where the shot was given as well as headaches tiredness and nausea the most common serious side effects of hpv vaccination are dizziness and fainting there is no evidence that hpv vaccines lead to infertility or autoimmune diseases although these are common myths when the researchers looked at the data by state they found that the number of parents citing safety concerns increased in states and more than doubled in california mississippi south dakota and hawaii vaccine misinformation on social media why are more parents concerned now about hpv vaccine safety than when it was first launched or in now that over million doses have been administered in the united states nosayaba osazuwa peters ph d m p h of the duke university school of medicine and his colleagues wrote in a commentary on the study studies have shown that while individuals trust medical professionals for health information a growing number are turning to the internet for first and second opinions about hpv hpv vaccines and hpv associated cancer they continued unfortunately some information about hpv vaccines and cancer found online and on social media is inaccurate there has been a rise in negative and incorrect information also called misinformation about hpv vaccines on social media in recent years dr sonawane noted and research has shown that parents who are exposed to misinformation about hpv vaccines on social media are less likely to vaccinate their children nationwide programs such as cdc s vaccinate with confidence program can help tackle vaccine misinformation and provide resources for effective communications dr sonawane said there are also resources like smartphone apps she added that teach health care providers effective strategies for talking with parents about the hpv vaccine changing parents minds even though vaccine hesitancy appears to be rising there is a subset of people who have misgivings about vaccines but are open to changing their minds dr vanderpool noted sarah kobrin ph d m p h head of nci s health systems and interventions research branch who wasn t involved in the study agreed i don t want to rush to the idea that the shift towards giving this reason of safety concerns means that fewer people will get the vaccine dr kobrin said you have to look at this finding and the vaccine uptake rates together according to recent data there has been a steady increase in hpv vaccination rates i think there are people who might be saying i m concerned about safety but if you had the opportunity to talk and listen to them to educate and to have an informed decision making type of conversation you might be able to move them in a direction where their safety concerns are addressed and there s more willingness to vaccinate dr vanderpool explained to change people s minds the key is to not be judgmental and to provide the time and space for in depth conversations dr kobrin noted you can t tell people they re wrong if you actually want them to hear alternative information if you doubt their good intentions they re not going to hear you out regardless of how sparse the evidence is for their beliefs she said a better approach dr kobrin went on would be to say let s all talk about why we believe what we believe what is the evidence let s sift it through together we all want the same thing in addition to thoughts and beliefs about a topic people s behavior is also influenced by the things they see their friends and family and important people in their community recommending or doing for themselves she added nci has funded research projects to explore the influence local organizations have on community members with hpv vaccine hesitancy although the results are yet to be published the studies suggest that well respected local organizations can have a positive influence on peoples perceptions about hpv vaccines dr kobrin said older post enhertu may be preferred therapy for some metastatic breast cancers

nci staff enlarge trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu has a chemotherapy payload that kills cancer cells directly and nearby cancer cells through a bystander effect credit gastric cancer may https doi org s cc by update on may the food and drug administration fda expanded the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu for the treatment of some adults with her positive breast cancer who have previously received a her targeted therapy under the approval the drug can be used in such adults if their cancer has spread metastatic or cannot be treated with surgery if they received the her targeted therapy before or after surgery for early stage breast cancer and their cancer returned during or within months of completing that treatment the approval was based on the results of the destiny breast trial details of which are discussed in the story below a new targeted drug markedly lengthened the time that people with an aggressive subtype of metastatic breast cancer lived without their cancer progressing new study results show in a head to head comparison trastuzumab deruxtecan enhertu was also better at shrinking tumors than another targeted drug trastuzumab emtansine kadcyla since trastuzumab emtansine commonly abbreviated as t dm has been the preferred second line treatment for people with metastatic breast cancer that overproduces the her protein known as her positive breast cancer interim results of the clinical trial which compared the two drugs in people whose disease had progressed after treatment with at least one earlier regimen for metastatic breast cancer were presented september at the european society for medical oncology esmo congress although the trial is ongoing a planned interim analysis of data from the study showed a clear difference between the two treatments twelve months after treatment started the cancer was still under control in nearly of people in the trastuzumab deruxtecan or t dxd group compared with of those treated with t dm said senior study investigator sara hurvitz m d of the ucla jonsson comprehensive cancer center the superior response to t dxd was very impressive and suggests that this drug should be the new standard second line treatment for such patients said alexandra zimmer m d clinical director of the women s malignancies branch in nci s center for cancer research who was not involved with the study in my years of experience as a breast cancer clinician i ve never seen such a marked improvement in efficacy with a new drug compared to the current standard therapy for metastatic breast cancer so it really is quite exciting for our patients dr hurvitz said comparing two targeted treatments in about of people with breast cancer tumors overproduce her with the excess her on tumor cells driving the cancer s growth such her positive tumors tend to grow faster and are more likely to spread elsewhere in the body or metastasize than those that do not overproduce her trastuzumab and other drugs called monoclonal antibodies that target her have been quite successful as treatments for her positive breast cancer as a result researchers have been developing new drugs based on these antibodies both t dm and t dxd which are given by infusion into a vein are drugs known as antibody drug conjugates adcs such drugs consist of a monoclonal antibody in this case trastuzumab chemically linked to a cell killing chemotherapy drug the trastuzumab component of both t dm and t dxd acts as a homing device that helps the drug deliver its chemotherapy payload directly to tumor cells that overproduce her the adc is then ferried inside the cell where the attached chemotherapy drug is released the new study a large international clinical trial called destiny breast is the first to directly compare t dxd with another treatment in people with breast cancer the trial was funded by daiichi sankyo inc and astrazeneca the developers of t dxd findings from a smaller clinical trial called destiny breast which were published last year led the food and drug administration to grant accelerated approval to t dxd as a treatment for people with inoperable or metastatic her positive breast cancer who had received at least two prior lines of her targeted treatment those results which showed that tumors responded to t dxd in about of patients who had already received numerous prior treatments were already impressive dr zimmer said but that trial did not directly compare the drug with other treatments we were waiting for t dxd to be compared to another treatment in a large clinical trial like destiny breast dr zimmer continued trastuzumab deruxtecan improves progression free survival shrinks more tumors the destiny breast trial enrolled people with her positive breast cancer that could not be removed by surgery or had metastasized to other parts of the body including the brain participants were randomly assigned to receive either t dm or t dxd all had previously received treatment with trastuzumab herceptin and a taxane based chemotherapy drug after months of follow up the median time that people who received t dm lived without their disease progressing was months in the t dxd treated group the median time without disease progression had not yet been reached after months tumors shrank or disappeared completely on imaging tests in about of patients who received t dxd compared with who were treated with t dm the research team is continuing to follow participants to learn if there is a difference in how long people in the two treatment groups live overall they will also compare participants quality of life in the two groups serious treatment related side effects occurred in about of people in the t dxd group and about of those in the t dm group said javier cort s m d ph d of the international breast cancer center in barcelona who presented the destiny breast findings at the esmo meeting almost of people in the t dxd group stopped treatment because of serious side effects compared with in the t dm group and more people in the t dxd group than the t dm group had the dose of the drug reduced due to side effects the main side effect that researchers were concerned about is a potentially serious type of lung inflammation this condition called interstitial lung disease or ild caused five treatment related deaths among the participants in the earlier destiny breast study because of this concern participants in destiny breast were carefully monitored for signs of ild dr hurvitz said although of people in the t dxd group developed ild compared with only in the t dm group in this much larger trial no one in either treatment group died of ild and no one had severe ild only two patients in the t dxd group had moderately severe ild she continued based on the new trial results i think we can put many of these concerns about ild aside said shanu modi m d who specializes in treating breast cancer at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york and who discussed the findings at the meeting however vigilance and early intervention is absolutely mandatory to deliver t dxd safely continued dr modi who was not involved in destiny breast but was an investigator in destiny breast people who develop signs of ild must immediately stop taking the drug may be given steroids to control lung inflammation and may be monitored by a lung specialist until the issue has resolved dr hurvitz said however she noted if a patient has shortness of breath or low oxygen levels due to ild the current recommendation is to permanently discontinue this drug explaining differences between two her targeting drugs several differences between t dxd and t dm could explain why t dxd is more effective dr cort s said the two drugs carry different types of chemotherapy payloads and each molecule of t dxd delivers about twice as much chemotherapy to her positive cells as a molecule of t dm does dr cort s explained perhaps most important studies in mice and lab grown cells indicate that once the chemotherapy component of t dxd has been released it can enter and kill neighboring cells including tumor cells that do not overproduce her in her positive breast cancer not all cells within a tumor overproduce her dr modi explained so this bystander effect of t dxd which has not been seen with t dm is particularly important for treating this form of breast cancer she said future directions numerous studies of t dxd alone or combined with other drugs in people with breast cancer as well as other cancer types that overproduce her including lung and stomach cancer are ongoing or planned or have recently concluded for example recent results from a small clinical trial showed that t dxd shrank tumors in more than half of people with previously treated her positive lung cancer researchers are now evaluating the drug in people with earlier stage her positive breast cancer to find out if it can halt the progress of or even cure the disease dr hurvitz said other studies including one led by dr zimmer at the nih clinical center will assess the effects of t dxd specifically on her positive breast cancer that has spread to the brain there is also a study looking at t dxd in her low breast cancer meaning it s not a her positive tumor but has a little bit of her on the surface of tumor cells dr hurvitz said about two thirds of hormone receptor positive breast cancers and roughly a third of triple negative breast cancers fall into this category she noted in addition dr modi said it remains to be seen whether t dm or other treatments can stop disease progression in people with metastatic her postive breast cancer whose disease eventually progresses on t dxd older post from scan to scan the challenges of living with metastatic

nci staff bethany ross has been living with metastatic neuroendocrine cancer since she was diagnosed in credit used with permission from bethany ross since bethany ross has started a new job run four half marathons and been treated for metastatic cancer the year old software engineer was diagnosed with stage iv neuroendocrine cancer years ago after vomiting every day for months doctors at the dana farber cancer institute found tumors in her appendix and pancreas and cancer cells that had spread to her liver and nearby lymph nodes after two surgeries and hormone injections to treat her symptoms ross received good news doctors could no longer detect cancer in her body she currently is not receiving any treatment for cancer but every few months for the rest of her life ross will go to dana farber for tests including imaging scans to see if the cancer has started to grow again my doctors say the disease will come back at some point they just can t tell me when said ross who lives in new hampshire with each scan i wonder if this is the one that will reveal a recurrence but ross is not just waiting for the cancer to come back she works full time and runs she has also spoken at medical conferences including a recent nci sponsored workshop about her experience living with metastatic cancer ross is part of a growing population of individuals who are living longer with advanced or metastatic cancer than was once possible in addition to skydiving bethany ross speaks at medical conferences about the challenges of living with advanced cancer credit used with permission from bethany ross new treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies have led to a real transition in survivorship said jennifer temel m d of massachusetts general hospital who studies cancer survivors and spoke at the nci conference people can stay on these treatments for many years which means they can survive for many years dr temel added until recently long term survivors of advanced or metastatic cancer have primarily been women with metastatic breast cancer but doctors are now seeing survivors with other types of cancer including lung gastrointestinal kidney cancer and melanoma the emergence of a growing population of people living with advanced or metastatic cancer has raised questions about the unique needs of these individuals and how to improve their care igniting a new field of research to address these questions nci sponsored a virtual meeting that brought together researchers health care providers patient advocates and people like ross who are living with advanced or metastatic cancer the meeting featured presentations by survivorship researchers and people living with advanced or metastatic disease as well as panel discussions each panel included at least one person living with cancer we came together to exchange ideas about how we are caring for these patients and what we can do better said temel our goal is to ignite a new field of research to better support and address the care needs of patients with advanced cancers people living with advanced or metastatic cancer have needs that may differ from those of people who have been treated for early stage cancers noted lisa gallicchio ph d of nci s division of cancer control and population sciences dccps who co led the meeting examples of these needs include the management of chronic conditions psychosocial support caregiver support financial support and communication around the goals of care people with advanced or metastatic cancer might require treatment for the disease indefinitely or they might be on and off treatment for the rest of their lives dr gallicchio said they will also likely undergo regular testing to identify signs of a recurrence the psychological impact of uncertainty although newer therapies can help some patients live longer clinicians cannot predict how long a treatment is going to be effective for an individual patient the psychological impact of this uncertainty on patients and their loved ones was a theme of the nci meeting said dr temel jamil rivers who was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer years ago at age spoke at the conference about the uncertainty of living with the disease after being diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer jamil rivers started the chrysalis initiative a nonprofit that helps women of color with breast cancer credit used with permission from jamil rivers when you learn that you have metastatic cancer and see the survival statistics it can be overwhelming emotionally said rivers and if you re living with metastatic cancer you re living from treatment to treatment from scan to scan rivers said that her latest imaging scans had not shown any tumors but i still have metastatic cancer she explained i have to be on some type of treatment to keep that cancer at bay so that it doesn t grow and wreak havoc on my body rivers also described financial challenges related to cancer she did not tell her employer about her diagnosis so that she could maintain her salary and her family s health insurance which was through the employer she continued to work for the year that she received chemotherapy life doesn t stop when you get diagnosed with cancer rivers said in an interview after the meeting i have a family to take care of we have a house and i need to put food on the table and buy the kids clothes rivers has founded the chrysalis initiative a nonprofit organization that aims to improve the lives of women of color with breast cancer who have historically had poorer outcomes than other women with the disease she has also shared her story through the national media putting a spotlight on the needs of people living with metastatic cancer and their loved ones at the conference rivers issued a call to action for all future studies and initiatives around cancer survivorship we should ask how does this research also help meet the needs of patients with metastatic cancer helping patients with scanxiety the stress that often accompanies the routine imaging scans that patients undergo to monitor changes in their health is sometimes called scanxiety scanxiety is a real phenomenon said dr temel it s natural to feel anxious when you re waiting for an important test result and i don t think there s a quick fix to it providing patients with information they can understand about their diagnosis and treatment is one way that dr temel tries to support her patients and lessen their stress we know that when patients have accurate information they are better prepared and make more appropriate decisions about the future she said she also conveys a message to her patients and families we re going to be here for you whether the scan result is good news or bad news and we have a plan for the future this reassurance may make the period of anxiety and worry slightly less distressing dr temel said then she added i hate waiting for test results too it s part of being human including many perspectives emily tonorezos m d director of nci s office of cancer survivorship said the conference created opportunities for researchers clinicians advocates and people living with advanced cancer to exchange ideas a publication summarizing the main discussions is in the works the importance of including the perspectives of patients and survivors in designing conducting and interpreting research findings emerged as a theme of the meeting said michelle mollica ph d of the healthcare delivery research program in dccps who co led the meeting christine hodgdon who has metastatic breast cancer believes researchers need to hear from people like her who live with advanced cancer credit used with permission from christine hodgdon christine hodgdon a patient advocate who is living with metastatic breast cancer and moderated a session at the meeting said the presence of people living with advanced cancer on every panel conveyed an important message researchers need to hear from people who are living with advanced cancer this was the first meeting i m aware of that focused specifically on survivorship and advanced cancer added hodgdon who lives in maryland and co founded the organization guiding researchers and advocates for scientific partnerships grasp which brings researchers and patients together as equal partners we believe there is a need to involve people with advanced disease in research and not just as participants in clinical trials said hodgdon patients could help plan a trial she suggested or assist even earlier in the process when researchers are asking what should i study following long term survivors over time investigators at the meeting stressed the need for large longitudinal studies that follow people living with advanced or metastatic cancer over time collecting information on the cancer types treatments and health histories of long term survivors very few such studies exist but they could help identify the unmet needs of patients and strategies for addressing these needs data from longitudinal studies could also reveal clues about why some patients with metastatic cancer survive for extended periods and potentially how to help more patients live longer several researchers said but they cautioned that the research will be challenging long term survivors are an incredibly heterogeneous group dr gallicchio noted these individuals are from diverse backgrounds and have different cancer diagnoses she continued they have also been treated with different therapies or treatment regimens exactly how many people are living with advanced or metastatic cancer is not known but a study found that the number of women living with metastatic breast cancer had been increasing supporting caregivers and coordinating care at the conference many participants stressed the need to learn more about how best to support the caregivers and family members of long term survivors rivers who has three children shared some challenges parents who are living with metastatic cancer may need help ensuring that their kids are supported emotionally she said after the meeting cancer treatments have a lot of side effects and it can be both scary and challenging to have conversations about these side effects with your family another challenge is coordinating care among various health care providers people living with advanced or metastatic cancer often receive new treatments and oncologists may need to communicate with primary care physicians about which side effects and possible complications to expect and how to address them health care providers also have limited information about the long term side effects of newer treatments which is another reason that the coordination of care and communication among providers is important several researchers noted during the nci meeting as new treatments for cancer are developed and cancer care improves the importance of understanding the needs of people living with metastatic or advanced cancer will increase the science is advancing so rapidly said bethany ross with these new and highly effective therapies more groups of patients are going to be living for longer periods of time older post pembrolizumab may help prevent early stage melanoma from returning newer post enhertu may be preferred therapy for some metastatic breast
